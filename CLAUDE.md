# Project Development & Documentation Rules

## 🚨 FIRST PRIORITY: DOCUMENTATION
**No docs? CREATE THEM FIRST.** Understand the system before coding. Update when understanding changes.

## 🔗 AUTOMATED LINK MANAGEMENT
**Check for `PythonHelpers/link_manager.py` first**
- If it exists → Use it
- If not → Create a Python script that:
  - Gets repo owner/name from git remote
  - Finds all web-accessible files (.html, .js, .json, etc.)
  - Generates GitHub Pages URLs: `https://[owner].github.io/[repo]/[path]`
  - Updates LINK.txt with proper URL encoding
  - Preserves existing descriptions

Run after ANY web file changes: `python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py`

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION FILES
Every `.html` needs a `.txt`: `dashboard.html` → `dashboard.txt`

**Required in each .txt:**
- What it does & data sources
- How it works (key functions)  
- Dependencies & integrations
- Corrections when initial understanding was wrong

Update docs with EVERY change. If wrong, fix immediately.

---

## 🔄 Git Rules
**Not on main = didn't happen.** Always work on main. Commit & push immediately after changes. End every response with PR link.

---

## 🔗 WEB FILE TRACKING (LINK.txt) - NOW AUTOMATED!
**Use the Python Link Manager for automatic tracking:**
```bash
python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py
```

### What Gets Tracked Automatically
**HTML Files** (.html)
- All runnable web pages
- Reason: These are the applications users access directly

**JavaScript Modules** (.js)
- Clean development versions (Jsmodules/*.js)
- Obfuscated production versions (Jsmodules-js/*-js.js)
- Reason: These need to be referenced/imported in web apps

**JSON Data Files** (.json) - if present
- Any data endpoints or configuration files
- Reason: Often loaded dynamically by web apps

**Standalone CSS** (.css) - if present
- Shared stylesheets referenced across pages
- Reason: May be loaded as separate resources

**What's NOT tracked:**
- Python scripts (.py) - run locally, not web-accessible
- CSV files (.csv) - source data, not web resources
- Text files (.txt) - documentation, not web resources

### How It Works
- Generates proper GitHub Pages URLs (https://username.github.io/repo/path/file.html)
- Handles special characters and spaces in filenames
- Preserves existing descriptions when updating

### Manual Review After Running Script
- Check LINK.txt for new entries marked with `[Add description for...]`
- Update these placeholders with meaningful descriptions
- Commit the updated LINK.txt with your code changes

### LINK.txt Format (Auto-generated)
```
# GitHub Pages Links for some-dude-999/LPH
# Auto-generated by PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

## HTML Pages
https://some-dude-999.github.io/LPH/index.html - Main landing page
https://some-dude-999.github.io/LPH/dashboard.html - Analytics dashboard

## JavaScript Modules (Clean - Development)
https://some-dude-999.github.io/LPH/SpanishWords/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js - Act 1 vocabulary (readable)

## JavaScript Modules (Obfuscated - Production)
https://some-dude-999.github.io/LPH/SpanishWords/Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js - Act 1 vocabulary (compressed)
```

## 📦 JAVASCRIPT MODULE STRUCTURE (CRITICAL!)
**JS modules are ACT-BASED, NOT pack-based!**

### ✅ CORRECT Structure (Spanish, English)
- **Group by Acts**: Multiple wordpacks combined into act files
- **File naming**: `act1-foundation.js`, `act2-building-blocks.js`, etc.
- **Benefits**:
  - Fewer HTTP requests (7 act files vs 250 pack files)
  - Better performance and caching
  - Cleaner import structure
  - Obfuscation works better on larger files

**Example (Spanish):**
```
SpanishWords/Jsmodules/
├── act1-foundation.js (116KB - contains packs 1-50)
├── act2-building-blocks.js (119KB - contains packs 51-100)
└── act3-daily-life.js (171KB - contains packs 101-150)
```

### ❌ INCORRECT Structure (Chinese - needs fixing)
- **Individual pack files**: One file per wordpack
- **File naming**: `pack1-greetings.js`, `pack2-pronouns.js`, etc.
- **Problems**:
  - 107+ separate HTTP requests
  - Poor performance
  - Harder to manage
  - Defeats obfuscation purpose

**Wrong example:**
```
ChineseWords/Jsmodules/
├── pack1-greetings_and_goodbyes.js (13KB)
├── pack2-personal_pronouns.js (11KB)
└── pack3-demonstratives.js (9KB)
... (107 files total - BAD!)
```

### Conversion Scripts
- **Location**: `[Language]Words/[Language]WordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py`
- **Input files needed**:
  - `[Language]WordsOverview.csv` - Maps packs to acts
  - `[Language]WordsMeta.csv` - Translations for pack titles (optional)
  - `[Language]Words{1-250}.csv` - Individual wordpack data
- **Output**:
  - Clean: `Jsmodules/act{N}-{name}.js` (readable for development)
  - Obfuscated: `Jsmodules-js/act{N}-{name}-js.js` (compressed for production)

### When to regenerate modules
- After editing any CSV file
- After changing act groupings in Overview.csv
- After updating meta translations
- Run: `python [Language]Words/[Language]WordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py`

## ⚠️ Remember
1. **NO DOCUMENTATION = STOP! Create it first before ANY other work**
2. **Check for PythonHelpers/link_manager.py first - use it if it exists!**
3. **Not on main = useless code**
4. **Incorrect understanding = update documentation immediately**
5. **Every change needs this exact sequence:**
   - Check/create documentation FIRST
   - Make code changes
   - Update documentation if understanding changed
   - **Run `python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py`** (auto-updates LINK.txt for all web files)
   - Review and update descriptions in LINK.txt
   - Git add, commit, push to main
   - Provide pull request link in response
6. **Documentation is a message to your future self - make it count!**

## 🎯 Quick Start Checklist for New Sessions
```bash
# 1. Check if link manager exists
ls PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

# 2. If not found, create it to track .html, .js, .json, .css files
mkdir -p PythonHelpers
# [create link_manager.py with the provided code]

# 3. After any web file changes (HTML, JS, JSON, CSS), run:
python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

# 4. Review and update LINK.txt descriptions

# 5. Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Updated web files and documentation"
git push origin main
```

## 🧠 Documentation Philosophy
**Think of documentation as a conversation with your future self:**
- What would you want to know if you saw this code for the first time?
- What mistakes might you make without proper context?
- What's the quickest path to understanding the entire system?
- Document not just WHAT the code does, but WHY it does it that way

This documentation system ensures that as projects grow, any new LLM can quickly understand the entire codebase, data flow, and system architecture.
