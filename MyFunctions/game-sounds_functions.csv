getAudioContext(),"Provides a singleton Web Audio API context for all game sounds. This is the foundation for all audio generation in the game, ensuring that all sounds share the same audio context to prevent audio glitches and memory leaks. The function returns the same AudioContext instance across all calls, which is critical for proper audio management in web applications.","Uses a lazy initialization pattern with a module-level variable 'audioContext'. On the first call, it checks if audioContext is null, and if so, creates a new AudioContext (or webkitAudioContext for older browsers) and stores it. On subsequent calls, it simply returns the existing instance. This singleton pattern ensures only one audio context exists throughout the application lifecycle, which is important because creating multiple audio contexts can cause performance issues and audio glitches. The function handles browser compatibility by checking for both 'window.AudioContext' and 'window.webkitAudioContext'.",10
playCardFlipSound(),"Generates and plays a soft, muffled, satisfying page-turn sound effect used when flipping flashcards between front and back. This sound was carefully tuned to feel like 'floating on clouds' - ultra-soft and pleasant, not harsh or jarring. The sound provides tactile audio feedback that enhances the card-flipping experience. Duration is 0.23 seconds, creating a brief but noticeable audio cue that the card state has changed.","Creates sound using the Web Audio API through procedural audio synthesis (generating sound from mathematical functions rather than loading audio files). First, gets the audio context via getAudioContext(). Creates an audio buffer lasting 0.23 seconds. Fills the buffer with white noise (random values between -1 and 1) shaped by an envelope function that creates two components: Math.sin(t * Math.PI) for the main amplitude envelope that fades in and out smoothly, and Math.sin(t * Math.PI * 0.38) for a subtle frequency modulation effect. Multiplies by 0.26 to control overall volume. The raw noise is then passed through two lowpass filters (400Hz and 580Hz) which cut out high frequencies, creating the muffled, soft quality. Finally applies a gain of 2.5 to boost the overall volume to audible levels. All audio nodes are connected in a chain (source → lowpass1 → lowpass2 → gain → destination) and the sound is triggered with source.start().",10
playDingSound(),"Plays a gentle, pleasant bell sound to indicate correct answers, achievements, or successful actions. The sound is a C major chord (C5-E5-G5) that creates a harmonious, uplifting feeling of success. Duration is 0.6 seconds with exponential decay, making it noticeable but not disruptive. This is the primary positive reinforcement sound in language learning games, rewarding learners when they get answers right.","Generates three simultaneous sine wave oscillators representing the notes C5 (523.25Hz), E5 (659.25Hz), and G5 (783.99Hz) which form a C major chord. For each note, creates an oscillator, a lowpass filter, and a gain node. The lowpass filter is set to 1500Hz to soften the sound and add warmth by removing harsh high frequencies. The volume decreases for each successive note in the chord (0.2, 0.16, 0.12) to create a natural harmonic balance where the root note is loudest. Each note's gain envelope starts at 0, ramps up to its target volume over 0.01 seconds (attack), then exponentially decays to near-silence (0.001) over 0.6 seconds. The three notes are staggered by 0.03 seconds each, creating a gentle arpeggio-like effect rather than all notes starting simultaneously. All three oscillators are connected through their respective filters and gains to the audio destination and started/stopped at their calculated times.",10
playBuzzSound(),"Plays a two-tone descending 'nope' sound to indicate wrong answers, failed attempts, or invalid actions. The sound descends from D4 (293.66Hz) to A3 (220Hz), creating a gentle rejection signal that's informative but not harsh or punishing. This provides negative feedback in a supportive way, helping learners recognize mistakes without feeling discouraged. Duration is brief (0.27 seconds total for both tones), so it doesn't interrupt the learning flow.","Creates two sequential sine wave oscillators at frequencies D4 (293.66Hz) and A3 (220Hz). For each tone, creates an oscillator, a lowpass filter at 800Hz (for gentleness), and a gain node. The two notes are staggered by 0.12 seconds - the first note starts immediately, the second starts 0.12s later. Each individual note has a 0.15 second duration with an amplitude envelope that ramps from 0 to 0.2 over 0.01 seconds, then exponentially decays to 0.001 over the remaining 0.15 seconds. The descending pitch pattern (high to low) creates the psychological association with incorrectness or failure. The lowpass filter keeps the sound warm and non-aggressive, making the feedback gentle rather than punishing. Both oscillators connect through their filters and gains to the audio destination.",10
playButtonClickSound(),"Plays a crisp, satisfying click sound for UI interactions like button presses and menu selections. This sound provides immediate tactile feedback that an action has been registered. The click is described as 'perfect' and 'balanced' with a subtle low end, designed to feel responsive and professional. Duration is very short (0.03 seconds) for instant feedback. The volume is notably louder (0.75) than other sounds to ensure it's clearly heard even during other game audio.","Generates white noise (random values) in a 0.03-second audio buffer, shaped with a very sharp exponential decay (power of 4.5) that creates an extremely fast attack and release - the quintessential click sound profile. The noise is then heavily filtered through two cascading lowpass filters at 800Hz and 1200Hz with a Q of 0.7, which removes high-frequency harshness and creates a muffled, thocky click quality. Additionally creates a simultaneous sine wave oscillator that sweeps from 120Hz down to 60Hz over 0.025 seconds at low volume (0.05), providing subtle low-end body to the click that makes it feel more substantial and tactile. The noise component provides the sharp attack 'click', while the low sine wave adds depth. Final gain of 0.75 makes this one of the loudest sound effects. All components connect to the destination and play synchronously.",10
playKeyboardSound(),"This is a reference implementation of a mechanical keyboard sound that's kept for documentation purposes but is not actively used in the current codebase. It demonstrates an alternative typing sound with a more clicky, high-frequency character. The function serves as a code example showing how to create a clicky mechanical keyboard sound if needed in the future. Currently, playScribbleSound() is used instead for actual typing feedback.","Creates a short 0.04-second burst of white noise with sharp exponential decay (power of 5). Passes the noise through a highpass filter at 2000Hz (removes low frequencies, keeping only treble), then through a bandpass filter centered at 4500Hz with a Q of 2 (selects a narrow frequency band for the characteristic 'click' sound). The highpass eliminates bass and mid frequencies, while the bandpass isolates the high-pitched 'click' frequency range that's characteristic of mechanical keyboard switches. Final gain is set to 0.3 for moderate volume. The filtering approach creates a bright, clicky sound profile. Connects source → highpass → bandpass → gain → destination. This function exists as a reference but playScribbleSound() is actually used in games because it has more variation and warmth.",10
playScribbleSound(),"Generates a satisfying mechanical keyboard typing sound with randomization for natural variation. This is the primary typing feedback sound, played on each keypress during typing practice modes. The sound has a clicky mechanical character that makes typing feel responsive and tactile, enhancing the typing experience. Duration is very short (0.015-0.025 seconds, randomly varied) to create crisp, distinct clicks for rapid typing. Each call produces slightly different sound characteristics to simulate real mechanical keyboard variation where each keypress sounds subtly different.","Uses procedural synthesis to create white noise shaped with an extremely sharp decay envelope (power of 8) for a crisp mechanical click attack. The duration is randomized between 0.015-0.025 seconds on each call, adding natural variation. The noise is processed through three filters: first a highpass at 400Hz removes low-frequency mud, then two bandpass filters create the mechanical keyboard frequency profile - one at 2000-3500Hz (randomized) with high Q of 4.0 for the sharp 'click' component, and another at 1000-1500Hz (randomized) with Q of 2.5 for the 'body' or 'thock' component. The randomized filter frequencies mean each keystroke sounds slightly different, mimicking real mechanical keyboard variation where key switches don't all sound identical. Final gain of 0.8 makes it prominent but not overwhelming. Connects: source → highpass → bandpass1 → bandpass2 → gain → destination. The combination of randomized duration and randomized filter frequencies creates organic typing sound variation.",10
