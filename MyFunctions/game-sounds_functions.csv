getAudioContext(),"Creates or returns singleton Web Audio API AudioContext for sound generation. Ensures only one context exists across all sound functions.","Checks if module-level audioContext variable is null. If so, creates new AudioContext using window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext constructor (webkitAudioContext for Safari compatibility). Returns the audioContext. This singleton pattern prevents creating multiple contexts which can cause browser issues and resource waste.",10
playCardFlipSound(),"Plays realistic page-turning/card-flip sound for flashcard interactions. Provides satisfying tactile feedback when cards are flipped.","Gets AudioContext via getAudioContext(). Generates two-part sound: PART 1 'LIFT' (page separating) - creates 0.08s buffer with brown noise shaped by envelope, filtered through 800Hz lowpass for paper character. PART 2 'SETTLE' (page landing) - creates 0.12s buffer with sharper attack (0.3 initial envelope), 600Hz lowpass for landing thud. Both parts connected: source→filter→gain→destination. Gain values ~0.15 for subtle effect. Total duration ~0.2 seconds.",10
playDingSound(),"Plays pleasant success/correct answer bell sound. Used when user gets answer right or completes a card successfully.","Gets AudioContext. Creates two oscillators for rich harmonic content: PRIMARY oscillator at 880Hz (A5 note) with 'sine' waveform, SECONDARY oscillator at 1320Hz (E6 - perfect fifth) with 'sine' waveform. Both share envelope with slow attack (0.01s), peak at 0.3 gain, gradual decay to 0 over 0.4 seconds using exponentialRampToValueAtTime. Oscillators connected through respective gain nodes to destination. Total duration ~0.4 seconds. Creates pleasant, musical 'ding' sound.",10
playBuzzSound(),"Plays error/wrong answer buzz sound. Provides immediate negative feedback for incorrect responses.","Gets AudioContext. Creates oscillator at 150Hz (low frequency for buzzy feel) with 'sawtooth' waveform for harsh harmonic content. Envelope: immediate full volume (0.25 gain), holds briefly, then rapid decay to 0 over 0.15 seconds. Creates biquadFilter with 'lowpass' at 300Hz to remove harsh high frequencies while keeping buzz character. Chain: oscillator→filter→gain→destination. Total duration ~0.15 seconds. Short, unpleasant but not jarring.",10
playButtonClickSound(),"Plays subtle UI click sound for button interactions. Provides feedback for menu selections and non-answer buttons.","Gets AudioContext. Creates 0.03 second buffer (very short click). Fills buffer with noise shaped by sharp exponential decay envelope (Math.pow(1-progress, 3)). Creates biquadFilter 'bandpass' at 2000Hz with Q=1 to create focused 'click' frequency. Gain set to 0.15 for subtle effect. Chain: source→filter→gain→destination. Total duration ~0.03 seconds. Crisp, minimal click that doesn't distract from gameplay.",10
playKeyboardSound(),"Plays mechanical keyboard click sound for typing practice. Provides satisfying feedback on every keystroke during typing mode.","Gets AudioContext. Creates very short duration buffer (0.02-0.03s with random variation for naturalness). Generates white noise with sharp decay envelope (Math.pow with factor 6 for crisp click). PRIMARY filter: bandpass at 2500-3500Hz (random) with Q=3 for mechanical click character. SECONDARY filter: bandpass at 1200-1800Hz (random) for body. Highpass at 500Hz removes low-end mud. Gain 0.25-0.35 with random variation. Total duration ~0.02-0.03 seconds. Sound varies slightly on each keystroke for realistic feel.",10
playScribbleSound(),"Plays pencil-on-paper scribble sound for handwriting/drawing modes. Creates realistic writing feel.","Gets AudioContext. Creates 0.05-0.08 second buffer (random duration for variation). Generates noise with moderate decay envelope. SCRATCH component: highpass filter at 800Hz for scratchy high frequencies. BODY component: bandpass at 400-600Hz for paper contact sound. Both components combined at different gain levels. Total gain ~0.2. Random variations in frequency and duration create realistic, non-repetitive scribble sound. Each call produces slightly different sound for natural feel.",10
