// DecoderTest.js - CSS-only version
// All game logic has been removed - this file is now minimal
// Game functionality should be handled by wordpack-logic.js

// This file intentionally left nearly empty after cleanup
// CSS is in DecoderTest.css
// DOM manipulation and game logic are in wordpack-logic.js
