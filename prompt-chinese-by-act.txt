CHINESE STAGE 3: TRANSLATION QUALITY REVIEW (BY ACT)

THE #1 RULE: ACTUAL TRANSLATIONS, NOT DESCRIPTIONS
---------------------------------------------------
Translations must be what you'd actually SAY in that language.
NOT grammar labels. NOT descriptions. NOT parenthetical notes.

WRONG: 个 (gè) -> "general measure word" (grammar description)
RIGHT: 个 (gè) -> "each" or "a/an" (actual translation)

WRONG: 的 (de) -> "possessive particle" (grammar label)
RIGHT: 的 (de) -> "'s" or "of" (actual translation)

WRONG: 只 (zhī) -> "(for animals)" (parenthetical note)
RIGHT: 只 (zhī) -> "one" (what you'd actually say)

Ask yourself: "Would a native speaker ever say this word?"
If no, it's not a translation - it's a description.

COLUMN 0 (chinese): SACRED - NEVER EDIT
OTHER COLUMNS: Find ACTUAL translations

CHECKLIST:
[+] Natural everyday words, not formal/technical
[+] What native speakers actually say
[+] Annotations OK: (masculine)/(feminine)/(formal)
[-] NO grammar labels as translations
[-] NO descriptions instead of translations
[-] NO parenthetical notes as entire translation
