PROJECT: LPH - Spanish Language Learning Platform
COMPONENT: Spanish Learners Demographics Visualization
CREATED: 2025-11-19
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-19 - Initial documentation created

DATA SOURCES:
- Static Data (Hardcoded in JavaScript): Demographic percentages embedded in the chart
- External Library: Chart.js v3+ (CDN: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js)
- Research Citations: References from multiple language learning studies
  * Mango Languages - Spanish study trends in US
  * NBC News - Chinese millennials learning Spanish
  * UT Permian Basin - K-12 Spanish enrollment statistics
  * Test Prep Insight - American language learning attempts
  * Speakeasy BCN - Global Spanish learners count
  * Preply - UK second language preferences

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Visualize the native language distribution of Spanish second-language learners worldwide
- Key Functions:
  * Chart.js pie chart rendering with 7 language categories
  * Data visualization showing: English (42%), Portuguese (18%), French (12%), Italian (10%), German (8%), Chinese (5%), Other (5%)
  * Display four statistical highlights: 24M+ total learners, 70% K-12 US enrollment, 36% US adults, 11% UK bilinguals
  * Smooth CSS animation on page load (fade-in and slide-up effect)
- Event Handlers:
  * DOMContentLoaded - triggers container fade-in animation
  * Chart tooltips - show percentage on hover

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: Chart.js (latest version from CDN)
- Project Files: None (standalone HTML file)
- APIs Required: None (all data is static)

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: None (standalone visualization)
- Sends data to: None
- Triggers: Auto-loads on page open

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially thought: This might dynamically fetch language learning data
- Actually: All data is static and hardcoded based on research citations
- Why this matters: No API calls needed; works offline; data must be manually updated if statistics change

NOTES:
- The file uses a playful, informal title despite being a serious demographic visualization
- Data percentages appear to be estimated/aggregated from multiple sources
- Chart uses responsive design with gradient background
- Links in sources section open in new tabs (base target="_blank")
- Future improvements could include:
  * Dynamic data fetching from a live API
  * Interactive filtering by region
  * Time-series data showing trends over years
