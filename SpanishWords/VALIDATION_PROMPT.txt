SPANISH WORDS COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION PROMPT
==============================================

Use this prompt to validate all Spanish word packs for correctness and quality.

TASK: Perform a comprehensive validation of all 250 Spanish word packs in the SpanishWords folder.

FILES TO CHECK:
- SpanishWords/SpanishWordsOverview.csv (master file)
- SpanishWords/SpanishWords1.csv through SpanishWords250.csv (word pack files)
- SpanishWords/000 SPANISH TRANSLATION FORMAT RULES.txt (format rules)

VALIDATION STEPS:
==================

1. WORD COUNT VALIDATION
   -----------------------
   For each pack in SpanishWordsOverview.csv:

   a) Verify total_words_actual (column 6) equals the actual count of words in Spanish_Words array (column 3)
   b) Verify total_words_actual is divisible by 3 (each base word must have exactly 3 examples)
   c) Verify manual_base_word_count (column 4) = total_words_expected (column 5) ÷ 3
   d) Verify total_words_expected = manual_base_word_count × 3
   e) Verify total_words_actual = total_words_expected (if not, pack needs fixing)

   Use helper script: python3 SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/check_divisible_by_3.py

2. CSV FILE MATCHING
   ------------------
   For each pack:

   a) Verify SpanishWords{N}.csv exists for pack N
   b) Verify the Spanish words in the CSV file exactly match the Spanish_Words array in overview
   c) Verify words are in the exact same order
   d) Verify CSV has exactly total_words_actual rows (excluding header)

   Use helper script: python3 SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/verify_csv_matches_overview.py

3. BASE WORD STRUCTURE VALIDATION
   -------------------------------
   For each pack's word array:

   a) Check if words are grouped in sets of 3
   b) Identify the base word for each group of 3
   c) Verify all 3 examples use the same base word appropriately
   d) Look at Pack_Title (column 2) to understand what the pack should contain

   Example from Pack 1 (Greetings & Goodbyes):
   - Group 1: "hola amigo", "hola señor", "hola todos" → base: "hola"
   - Group 2: "adiós amigos", "adiós señora", "adiós hasta luego" → base: "adiós"

   Use helper script: python3 SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/examine_pack_structure.py {pack_number}

4. WORD QUALITY AND USEFULNESS CHECK
   -----------------------------------
   For each group of 3 words in a pack:

   a) Are the 3 examples MAXIMALLY USEFUL and COMMON?
      - Do they use high-frequency vocabulary?
      - Are they practical phrases a learner would actually use?
      - Do they cover different contexts/situations?

   b) Do the examples follow natural Spanish usage?
      - Not overly formal or archaic
      - Not too colloquial or slang
      - Appropriate for general Spanish learning

   c) Do the 3 examples provide good variety?
      - Different objects/subjects where appropriate
      - Different contexts (e.g., "hola amigo", "hola señor", "hola todos")
      - Maximize learning value

   d) Check against Pack_Title - do the words fit the theme?
      - Pack 1 "Greetings & Goodbyes" should only have greetings/goodbyes
      - Pack 8 "Having & Age (tener)" should focus on "tener" expressions
      - etc.

5. TRANSLATION FORMAT VALIDATION
   ------------------------------
   For each word in the CSV files, verify:

   a) NO slashes in Spanish column (combining alternatives like "gato/gatos" is FORBIDDEN)
   b) English uses ONLY allowed markers: (masculine), (feminine), (formal), (plural), (singular)
   c) NO disallowed markers like: (infinitive), (preterite), (NOT...), (permanent), etc.
   d) Chinese translations are natural and idiomatic (not word-for-word)
   e) Chinese uses appropriate particles (了, 一下, 吗, etc.) where needed
   f) Pinyin exactly matches Chinese characters with proper tone marks
   g) Portuguese is natural Brazilian Portuguese (not literal from Spanish)

   Reference: SpanishWords/000 SPANISH TRANSLATION FORMAT RULES.txt

6. VERB PACK PATTERN VALIDATION
   -----------------------------
   For verb-focused packs (like Pack 8 "tener", Pack 20 "hacer", etc.):

   Expected structure (30 words = 10 base words × 3):
   - Groups 1-6: Conjugations (yo, tú, él/ella, nosotros, vosotros, ellos) = 18 words
   - Group 7: Infinitive forms = 3 words
   - Group 8: Noun forms = 3 words
   - Group 9-10: Related verbs or expressions = 6 words

   Verify this pattern is followed consistently.

COMMON ISSUES TO LOOK FOR:
===========================

1. Word count not divisible by 3
2. Extra word in a group (e.g., 31 words instead of 30)
3. Missing word in a group (e.g., 29 words instead of 30)
4. Base word changes within a group of 3
5. Low-frequency or overly academic vocabulary
6. Repetitive examples (not enough variety)
7. Examples that don't fit the pack theme
8. Format rule violations (slashes, wrong markers, etc.)

HELPER SCRIPTS:
===============

All scripts are in SpanishWords/SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/

1. check_divisible_by_3.py - Finds packs with counts not divisible by 3
2. examine_pack_structure.py <pack_number> - Shows pack structure with groupings
3. verify_word_counts.py - Checks Word_Count column accuracy
4. verify_csv_matches_overview.py - Checks CSV files match overview

See SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/README.txt for full documentation.

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
================

After validation, provide:

1. Summary statistics:
   - Total packs checked: 250
   - Packs with word count errors: X
   - Packs with quality issues: Y
   - Packs with format violations: Z

2. Detailed list of issues found:
   - Pack N: Description of issue
   - Pack M: Description of issue
   - etc.

3. For each issue, provide:
   - What's wrong
   - Which specific words/groups are problematic
   - Suggested fix (what to add/remove/change)

4. Verification that fixes maintain:
   - Word count divisibility by 3
   - Maximum usefulness of vocabulary
   - Compliance with all format rules

EXAMPLE VALIDATION:
===================

Pack 208: Increasing (aumentar)
- Word count: 30 ✓ (divisible by 3)
- Base words: 10 ✓ (30 ÷ 3 = 10)
- Structure: Conjugations (18) + Infinitives (3) + Nouns (3) + Related (6) ✓
- Quality check:
  - "aumento precios" - common, useful ✓
  - "aumento peso" - common, useful ✓
  - "aumento velocidad" - common, useful ✓
  - All examples use high-frequency vocabulary ✓
- CSV match: SpanishWords208.csv has 30 rows matching overview ✓
- Format: All translations follow rules ✓

STATUS: PASS ✓
