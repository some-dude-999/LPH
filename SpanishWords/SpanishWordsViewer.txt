PROJECT: LPH - Spanish Language Learning Platform
COMPONENT: Interactive Spanish Vocabulary Pack Viewer
CREATED: 2025-11-19
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-19 - Initial documentation created

DATA SOURCES:
- CSV Files (Local): 251 CSV files in the SpanishWords directory
  * SpanishWordsOverview.csv - Master index with pack metadata
  * SpanishWords1.csv through SpanishWords250.csv - Individual vocabulary packs
- File Structure:
  * Headers: spanish, english, chinese, pinyin, portuguese
  * Each pack contains 24-45 translation entries
  * Total: ~10,685 vocabulary entries across all packs

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Browse and study all 250 Spanish vocabulary packs with multi-language translations
- Key Functions:
  * populateDropdown() - Generates 251 options (1 overview + 250 packs)
  * parseCSV(text) - Converts CSV text into structured data
  * parseCSVLine(line) - Handles quoted fields, commas, and escaped quotes
  * createTable(headers, rows, isOverview) - Generates HTML table from CSV data
  * loadCSV(filename) - Fetches and displays selected CSV file
  * updateInfoBar(packName, wordCount) - Shows pack statistics
  * escapeHtml(text) - Prevents XSS attacks
- Event Handlers:
  * DOMContentLoaded - Initializes app and loads overview
  * Dropdown change - Loads selected pack
- Display Features:
  * Sticky table headers for easy scrolling
  * Alternating row colors for readability
  * Hover effects on table rows
  * Loading spinner during fetch
  * Error messages for missing files
  * Responsive design for mobile devices

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (pure vanilla JavaScript)
- Project Files:
  * SpanishWordsOverview.csv (required)
  * SpanishWords1.csv through SpanishWords250.csv (required)
  * All must follow the format rules in "000 SPANISH TRANSLATION FORMAT RULES.txt"
- APIs Required: None (uses Fetch API for local files)

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: Local CSV files in SpanishWords directory
- Sends data to: None (read-only viewer)
- Triggers: User dropdown selection
- Related Components:
  * CsvViewerForManuallyBuildingCSV.html - Used to create the source CSV files
  * 000 SPANISH TRANSLATION FORMAT RULES.txt - Defines data structure requirements
  * SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/ - Validates CSV data integrity

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially thought: Files might be fetched from an external server
- Actually: Uses client-side Fetch API to load local CSV files from same directory
- Why this matters: Requires proper file paths when deployed; BASE_PATH variable may need adjustment for GitHub Pages vs local testing

NOTES:
- BASE_PATH constant set to './' - adjust for different deployment environments
- TOTAL_PACKS constant set to 250 - update if more packs are added
- Overview table has special styling for the third column (pack arrays in monospace)
- Works offline once files are loaded
- File naming convention must be exact: SpanishWords[1-250].csv
- CSV parsing handles edge cases:
  * Quoted fields with commas inside
  * Escaped quotes (double quotes)
  * Empty lines are filtered out
- Future improvements could include:
  * Search/filter functionality
  * Flashcard mode for studying
  * Progress tracking (mark words as learned)
  * Audio pronunciation integration
  * Random word quiz generator
  * Export selected words to study list
  * Dark mode toggle
