SPANISH STAGE 3: TRANSLATION QUALITY REVIEW (BY ACT)

THE #1 RULE: ACTUAL TRANSLATIONS, NOT DESCRIPTIONS
---------------------------------------------------
Translations must be what you'd actually SAY in that language.
NOT grammar labels. NOT descriptions. NOT parenthetical notes.

Ask yourself: "Would a native speaker ever say this word?"
If no, it's not a translation - it's a description.

COLUMN 0 (spanish): SACRED - NEVER EDIT
OTHER COLUMNS: Find ACTUAL translations

CHECKLIST:
[+] Natural everyday words, not formal/technical
[+] What native speakers actually say
[+] Annotations OK: (masculine)/(feminine)/(formal)/(informal)
[-] NO grammar labels as translations
[-] NO descriptions instead of translations
[-] NO parenthetical notes as entire translation
