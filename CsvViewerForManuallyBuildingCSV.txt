PROJECT: LPH - Spanish Language Learning Platform
COMPONENT: CSV Parser, Viewer, and Downloader Tool
CREATED: 2025-11-19
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-19 - Initial documentation created

DATA SOURCES:
- User Input: Pasted CSV text in textarea
- Form Fields:
  * Has Header Row checkbox (default: checked)
  * Count Mode checkbox (default: unchecked)
  * Filename input field (default: "data")

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Manually build, view, and download CSV files with live preview
- Key Functions:
  * parseCSV() - Parses pasted CSV text handling quoted fields with commas
  * displayTable(data, hasHeader) - Renders CSV data as HTML table
  * downloadCSV() - Generates and downloads CSV file with proper escaping
  * openNewTab() - Opens duplicate tool instance in new browser tab
  * showStatus(message, type) - Displays success/error messages
  * escapeHtml(text) - Prevents XSS attacks in displayed content
- Event Handlers:
  * Parse CSV button - Manually trigger CSV parsing
  * Download CSV button - Generate downloadable .csv file
  * New Tab button - Open tool in new window
  * Auto-parse on paste - Automatically parses CSV when data is pasted
  * Has Header Row checkbox change - Redraws table with/without header
  * Count Mode checkbox - Enables auto-increment filename feature
- Special Features:
  * Count Mode: Auto-increments filename on each paste (data → data1 → data2...)
  * Handles quoted CSV fields with embedded commas and newlines
  * Proper CSV escaping on download (quotes, commas, newlines)
  * Responsive table display with hover effects

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (pure vanilla JavaScript)
- Project Files: None (standalone tool)
- APIs Required: None (client-side only)

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: User manual input via paste/typing
- Sends data to: Browser downloads folder (CSV file)
- Triggers: User-initiated actions (paste, button clicks)
- Likely Used For: Creating the 250 SpanishWords*.csv files in this project

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially thought: This might integrate with the Spanish words data
- Actually: Standalone tool for general CSV creation/editing
- Why this matters: Generic utility that can be used for any CSV data, not specific to Spanish words

NOTES:
- The "Count Mode" feature is particularly useful for batch CSV creation
- Auto-parse on paste makes workflow very efficient for rapid CSV building
- Download button stays disabled until CSV is successfully parsed
- Table alternates row colors for better readability
- Works entirely offline - no server required
- Perfect for quickly prototyping CSV data structures
- Future improvements could include:
  * Column sorting functionality
  * Row editing/deletion
  * Import from file button
  * CSV validation rules
  * Export to other formats (JSON, TSV)
