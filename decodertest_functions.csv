Function Name,What It Does,How Does It Work,Reusability Score (1-10)
saveState,"Saves all user-configurable settings to localStorage (DELETED - now in wordpack-logic.js)","Deleted from DecoderTest - function moved to wordpack-logic.js as window.saveState(). Original implementation: created state object with all settings, used JSON.stringify(), called localStorage.setItem() with try-catch error handling",10
loadState,"Loads saved state from localStorage with error handling (DELETED - now in wordpack-logic.js)","Deleted from DecoderTest - function moved to wordpack-logic.js as window.loadState(). Original implementation: called localStorage.getItem(), used try-catch with JSON.parse(), returned parsed object or null on error",10
restoreSavedState,"Restores saved state and validates values against current valid options (DELETED - now in wordpack-logic.js)","Deleted from DecoderTest - function moved to wordpack-logic.js. Original implementation: called loadState(), checked if result exists, validated each field against VALID_* arrays (languages, acts, packs), only restored if valid, set hasRestoredState flag, returned boolean indicating if state was restored",9
initialize,"Main initialization that restores state, loads language data, validates state, sets up UI, and displays vocabulary","Calls restoreSavedState() to load saved settings, calls loadLanguageData() with current language (async await), calls validateAndFixState() to ensure act/pack exist, calls setupLanguageRadioButtons() to attach language switcher events, calls setupModeCheckboxes() to attach mode radio events, calls populateActDropdown(), populateNativeLanguageDropdown(), calls syncUIToState() to set UI element values, if valid act/pack exists sets dropdown values and calls displayVocabulary(), otherwise calls autoSelectFirstActAndPack(), updates debug info text",6
