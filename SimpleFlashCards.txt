PROJECT: LPH Spanish Learning
COMPONENT: Simple Flashcards - Interactive Spanish vocabulary practice
CREATED: 2025-11-23
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-23 - Updated card animations (slide-off removal, multi-card insertion)

DATA SOURCES:
- Module: https://some-dude-999.github.io/LPH/SpanishWords/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js
  Provides wordpacks with Spanish vocabulary and translations (english, chinese, portuguese)
- LocalStorage: Saves user preferences (voice selection, speech speed)
- Web Speech API: Text-to-speech and speech recognition for pronunciation

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Spanish vocabulary flashcard practice with interactive features
- Key Functions:
  * loadWordpacks() - Dynamically imports vocabulary modules
  * initializeDeck(packKey) - Creates shuffled deck from selected wordpack
  * updateDisplay() - Renders current card with weathering effects
  * removeCurrentCard() - Removes mastered card with slide-off animation
  * addConfusedCards() - Adds 2 copies of difficult card with visual feedback
  * speakSpanish() - Text-to-speech pronunciation
  * startListening() - Speech recognition for pronunciation practice
  * calculateSimilarity() - Levenshtein distance for pronunciation scoring

- Event Handlers:
  * Card flip - Click card or up/down arrows
  * Navigation - Arrow buttons or left/right arrows
  * Got it (👌) - Remove current card from deck
  * Confused (😕) - Add 2 extra practice copies
  * Sound (🔊) - Play pronunciation
  * Microphone (🎤) - Practice pronunciation with feedback

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (vanilla JavaScript)
- Fonts: Google Fonts (Cinzel, IM Fell English)
- APIs:
  * Web Speech API (speechSynthesis for TTS)
  * SpeechRecognition API for pronunciation practice
- Module Imports: act1-foundation.js (wordpack data)

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: Wordpack modules loaded dynamically
- Sends data to: LocalStorage for preference persistence
- Triggers: User interactions (clicks, keyboard, voice)

ANIMATIONS:
- Card Flip: Soft audio cue with visual flip transition
- Card Remove: Slide-off animation (0.5s) - card slides right with 25° rotation when mastered
  * JavaScript timeout: 500ms to match animation duration
- Card Add: Multi-card insertion animation (0.6s) - 2 extra cards slide in from behind using ::before and ::after pseudo-elements
  * Cards slide from left and right (-60px/+60px) with scale and opacity transitions
  * JavaScript timeout: 600ms to match animation duration
  * Main card does subtle pop effect (scale 1.03 → 0.98 → 1.0)
- Stamps: "Card Removed" and "Extra Practice" overlays with realistic ink effect (1s display before animation)

AUDIO FEATURES:
- Card Flip Sound: Muffled paper-like sound (Cloud Nine Ultra Soft)
- Button Click: Satisfying snap sound (Click Snap J)
- Speech Speed: Adjustable (Slow, Normal, Fast)
- Voice Selection: Multiple Spanish voices available
- Pronunciation Scoring: Real-time feedback with similarity percentage

VISUAL DESIGN:
- Theme: Old paper/parchment aesthetic with cardboard buttons
- Textures: Procedural SVG noise for paper and cardboard
- Weathering: Random edge fading for each card
- Stamps: Realistic ink-on-paper blend mode effects

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
[None yet - initial documentation]

NOTES:
- Audio code has important comments about preservation - DO NOT DELETE sound generation code
- State persistence only saves preferences (voice, speed), not deck progress
- Card removal and addition have stamp overlays with 1-second display before animation
- Future LLMs: Read this documentation before making changes to understand the system
