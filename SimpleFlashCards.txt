PROJECT: LPH Spanish Learning
COMPONENT: Simple Flashcards - Interactive Spanish vocabulary practice
CREATED: 2025-11-23
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-23 - Added three learning modes with typing game and updated controls

DATA SOURCES:
- Module: https://some-dude-999.github.io/LPH/SpanishWords/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js
  Provides wordpacks with Spanish vocabulary and translations (english, chinese, portuguese)
- LocalStorage: Saves user preferences (voice selection, speech speed)
- Web Speech API: Text-to-speech and speech recognition for pronunciation

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Spanish vocabulary flashcard practice with three interactive learning modes
- Learning Modes:
  * 📖 Reading Mode - Traditional flashcards (Spanish on front, translation on back)
  * 👂 Listening Mode - Audio focus (? on front, Spanish | Translation on back, auto-pronounces)
  * ✏️ Writing Mode - Typing game (type Spanish word letter-by-letter with mechanical keyboard sound)

- Key Functions:
  * loadWordpacks() - Dynamically imports vocabulary modules
  * initializeDeck(packKey) - Creates shuffled deck from selected wordpack
  * updateDisplay() - Renders current card based on active mode
  * switchMode(mode) - Changes between reading/listening/writing modes
  * handleTypingInput(key) - Processes typed letters in writing mode (case/accent insensitive)
  * normalizeChar(char) - Removes accents and lowercases for matching (á→a, é→e)
  * playKeyboardSound() - Mechanical keyboard click sound for each correct letter
  * removeCurrentCard() - Removes mastered card from deck
  * addConfusedCards() - Adds 2 copies of difficult card
  * speakSpanish() - Text-to-speech pronunciation
  * startListening() - Speech recognition for pronunciation practice
  * calculateSimilarity() - Levenshtein distance for pronunciation scoring

- Event Handlers:
  * Mode buttons (top left) - Switch between reading/listening/writing modes
  * Card flip - Click card or down arrow
  * Navigation - Left/right arrows
  * Pronunciation - Up arrow (always) or Space (reading/listening only)
  * Typing - Letter keys in writing mode
  * Enter - Advance to next card if word complete (writing mode)
  * Got it (👌) - Remove current card from deck
  * Confused (😕) - Add 2 extra practice copies
  * Sound (🔊) - Play pronunciation
  * Microphone (🎤) - Practice pronunciation with feedback

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (vanilla JavaScript)
- Fonts: Google Fonts (Cinzel, IM Fell English)
- APIs:
  * Web Speech API (speechSynthesis for TTS)
  * SpeechRecognition API for pronunciation practice
- Module Imports: act1-foundation.js (wordpack data)

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: Wordpack modules loaded dynamically
- Sends data to: LocalStorage for preference persistence
- Triggers: User interactions (clicks, keyboard, voice)

ANIMATIONS:
- Card Flip: Soft audio cue with visual flip transition
- Card Remove/Add: No animations - stamps only
  * Show stamp for 1 second, then immediately change to next card
  * No slide-off or insertion effects

STAMPS (REALISTIC DESIGN):
- "Card Removed" (red) and "Extra Practice" (green) overlays
- Realistic stamp styling:
  * Centered on card with -15° rotation
  * Georgia Bold serif font for classic stamp look
  * Hollow text (transparent fill with 3px stroke outline)
  * Large text (2.5rem) with solid border (4px)
  * Semi-transparent (70% opacity) with multiply blend mode
  * Blends into paper like real rubber stamp
  * Red (#D32F2F) for removed, Green (#388E3C) for added

AUDIO FEATURES:
- Card Flip Sound: Muffled paper-like sound (Cloud Nine Ultra Soft)
- Button Click: Satisfying snap sound (Click Snap J)
- Mechanical Keyboard Sound: Tactile click for each correct letter typed (Writing mode)
- Speech Speed: Adjustable (Slow, Normal, Fast)
- Voice Selection: Multiple Spanish voices available
- Pronunciation Scoring: Real-time feedback with similarity percentage
- Auto-Pronounce: Automatic pronunciation in Listening and Writing modes

VISUAL DESIGN:
- Theme: Old paper/parchment aesthetic with cardboard buttons
- Textures: Procedural SVG noise for paper and cardboard
- Card Weathering (Front):
  * Stronger sun-faded edges (15-25% fade depth)
  * Overall color variations with subtle splotches across entire card
  * Random positions and intensities for natural aging effect
  * Dashed border inset for torn paper effect
- Card Back Design:
  * Pale background with subtle color variations
  * Criss-crossing grid pattern (20px spacing, subtle brown)
  * Different visual pattern to distinguish from front
  * Subconsciously pleasing rustic paper feel

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
[None yet - initial documentation]

NOTES:
- Audio code has important comments about preservation - DO NOT DELETE sound generation code
- State persistence only saves preferences (voice, speed), not deck progress
- Card removal and addition have stamp overlays with 1-second display before animation
- Future LLMs: Read this documentation before making changes to understand the system
