STAGE 3: TRANSLATION QUALITY REVIEW
================================================================================

WHAT THIS STAGE DOES:
Review breakout CSVs and fix bad translations.

THE #1 RULE - ACTUAL TRANSLATIONS, NOT DESCRIPTIONS:
----------------------------------------------------
Translations must be what you'd actually SAY in that language.
NOT grammar labels. NOT descriptions. NOT parenthetical notes.

WRONG: 个 (gè) → "general measure word" (grammar description)
RIGHT: 个 (gè) → "each" or "a/an" (actual translation)

WRONG: 的 (de) → "possessive particle" (grammar label)
RIGHT: 的 (de) → "'s" or "of" (actual translation)

WRONG: 只 (zhī) → "(for animals)" (parenthetical note)
RIGHT: 只 (zhī) → "one" (what you'd actually say)

WRONG: 条 (tiáo) → "long object measure word"
RIGHT: 条 (tiáo) → "a" or "one" (functional equivalent)

Ask yourself: "Would a native speaker ever say this word?"
If the answer is no, it's not a translation - it's a description.

TRANSLATION PRIORITY:
1. Functional meaning - What does this word DO in a sentence?
2. Natural equivalent - What would a native speaker say?
3. Pack theme context - Same word can translate differently per theme

GOOD vs BAD EXAMPLES:
---------------------
Pack: "Core Measure Words"
  BAD:  个 → "general measure word"
  GOOD: 个 → "each" (because that's what 个 functionally means)

Pack: "Animals"
  BAD:  只 → "(for animals)"
  GOOD: 只 → "one" (as in "one cat" = 一只猫)

Pack: "Books"
  BAD:  本 → "(for books)"
  GOOD: 本 → "a/one" (as in "a book" = 一本书)

WHEN ANNOTATIONS ARE OK:
------------------------
Annotations disambiguate, they don't replace translations:
  OK: "the (masculine)" for Spanish "el"
  OK: "you (formal)" for Spanish "usted"
  NOT OK: "(general)" as the entire translation

CHINESE STAGE 3 PROMPT (ALL 107 PACKS)
================================================================================

COL 0 (chinese): SACRED - NEVER EDIT
OTHER COLS: Find ACTUAL translations (not descriptions!)

THE RULE: Would a native speaker say this word?
  NO grammar labels ("measure word", "classifier", "particle")
  NO parenthetical notes as translations ("(general)", "(for animals)")
  YES functional equivalents ("each", "a/an", "one", "'s")

EXAMPLES:
  WRONG: 个 → "general measure word"  |  RIGHT: 个 → "each"
  WRONG: 只 → "(for animals)"         |  RIGHT: 只 → "one"
  WRONG: 的 → "possessive particle"   |  RIGHT: 的 → "'s" or "of"
