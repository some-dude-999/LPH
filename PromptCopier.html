    <div class="label">Click to copy</div>
    <div class="prompt-box" onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Review and perfect Chinese_Base_Words in ChineseWordsOverview.csv

WHAT ARE BASE WORDS?
Base words are VOCABULARY ITEMS - single words or compound words that learners memorize.
Examples of good base words: 你好, 星期六, 电脑, 谢谢, 早上好

WHAT BASE WORDS ARE NOT:
Base words are NOT phrases, sentences, or words with added context.
- ✗ 我说你好 (this is a phrase/sentence - NOT a base word)
- ✗ 他的电脑 (this adds context - NOT a base word)
- ✓ 你好 (this is a vocabulary item - GOOD)
- ✓ 电脑 (this is a vocabulary item - GOOD)

CONTEXT COMES LATER - NOT NOW!
In Stage 2, we will create Example_Words that show base words in context.
Your job in Stage 1 is ONLY to ensure the base words themselves are good vocabulary items.

WHAT TO EVALUATE (1-10 score):
- Does each base word fit the pack's theme?
- Are the base words useful vocabulary items learners should know?
- Are there duplicates or too-similar words within the pack?
- Are there obvious missing words for this theme?
- Is the difficulty appropriate?

DO NOT:
- Turn base words into phrases or sentences
- Add context to base words
- Worry about "lack of context" - that's Stage 2's job

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文) - NEVER Traditional Chinese
- Keep base words as vocabulary items
- You CAN add/remove/replace base words
- Roughly 15-20 words per pack is typical but very flexible

NO DUPLICATES ACROSS PACKS:
After making changes, run: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
Each base word should appear in ONLY ONE pack across the entire language.
If a word appears in multiple packs, decide which pack it fits best and remove it from others.

IDENTIFY GAPS - SUGGEST NEW PACKS:
As you review, note if there are obvious theme gaps that deserve their own pack.
If you identify a gap, suggest a new pack title and what base words it should contain.
Example: "Gap identified: No pack for kitchen vocabulary. Suggest new Pack 'Kitchen Items' with base words: [锅, 碗, 筷子, 勺子, ...]"

FILE: ChineseWordsOverview.csv
COLUMN: Chinese_Base_Words

WORKFLOW:
1. BEFORE: Score the base words 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: Add/remove/replace vocabulary items as needed
3. RUN DUPLICATE CHECK: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
4. FIX any cross-pack duplicates
5. IDENTIFY GAPS: Suggest new packs if obvious themes are missing
6. AFTER: Score again, summarize improvements

    <h2>Stage 2: Create Example Words</h2>

    <h3>Chinese - Stage 2</h3>
    <div class="label">Click to copy</div>
    <div class="prompt-box" onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Create Chinese_Example_Words column in ChineseWordsOverview.csv

PREREQUISITE: Stage 1 must be complete. The Chinese_Base_Words column should already be finalized.

YOUR GOAL: For each base word, create 2 example phrases/sentences that CONTAIN that base word. These examples help learners see the vocabulary in context.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文) - NEVER Traditional Chinese
2. Each base word needs exactly 2 examples
3. Each example MUST CONTAIN its corresponding base word as a substring
4. Examples should be natural, useful phrases learners would actually use

FILE: ChineseWordsOverview.csv
COLUMN TO CREATE: Chinese_Example_Words

STRUCTURE:
If Base_Words = [词1, 词2, 词3]
Then Example_Words = [词1的例子A, 词1的例子B, 词2的例子A, 词2的例子B, 词3的例子A, 词3的例子B]

The pairing is:
- examples[0], examples[1] → contain base_words[0]
- examples[2], examples[3] → contain base_words[1]
- examples[4], examples[5] → contain base_words[2]
- And so on...

EXAMPLE:
Base_Words: [你好, 再见, 谢谢]
Example_Words: [你好吗, 你好啊, 再见朋友, 再见了, 谢谢你, 谢谢啊]

Notice: 你好吗 and 你好啊 both contain 你好

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
After creating Example_Words, use Python to:
1. Create Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (merged, no duplicates)
2. Check that every example contains its base word
3. Check for duplicate entries within the same pack
4. Check that word count in Example_Words = 2 × word count in Base_Words

Create a Python script to automate these checks. Save results to Chinese_Example_Words and Chinese_Combined_Words columns.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read the finalized Base_Words for each pack
2. For each base word, create 2 natural example phrases containing that word
3. Build the Example_Words array in correct order
4. Run validation script
5. Fix any issues
6. Save to CSV

    <h2>Stage 3: Create Breakout CSVs</h2>

    <h3>Chinese - Stage 3</h3>
    <div class="label">Click to copy</div>
    <div class="prompt-box" onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Create breakout CSV files (ChineseWords1.csv, ChineseWords2.csv, etc.) from ChineseWordsOverview.csv

PREREQUISITE: Stage 2 must be complete. The Chinese_Combined_Words column should exist with all vocabulary.

YOUR GOAL: For each pack, create a breakout CSV file with full translations for every word in Combined_Words.

FILE TO READ: ChineseWordsOverview.csv (Chinese_Combined_Words column)
FILES TO CREATE: ChineseWords/ChineseWords1.csv, ChineseWords/ChineseWords2.csv, ... ChineseWords/ChineseWords107.csv

BREAKOUT CSV COLUMNS (12 columns, in this exact order):
1. chinese - The Chinese word/phrase (Simplified only!)
2. pinyin - Pinyin with tone marks
3. english - English translation
4. spanish - Spanish translation
5. french - French translation
6. portuguese - Portuguese translation
7. vietnamese - Vietnamese translation
8. thai - Thai translation
9. khmer - Khmer/Cambodian translation
10. indonesian - Indonesian translation
11. malay - Malay translation
12. filipino - Filipino/Tagalog translation

CRITICAL PINYIN RULE:
Each Chinese character MUST have exactly ONE pinyin syllable, separated by spaces.
This is because our app displays pinyin directly under each character.

CORRECT PINYIN FORMAT:
- 猴子 → hóu zi (2 characters = 2 syllables with space)
- 你好 → nǐ hǎo (2 characters = 2 syllables with space)
- 星期六 → xīng qī liù (3 characters = 3 syllables with spaces)
- 我爱你 → wǒ ài nǐ (3 characters = 3 syllables with spaces)

INCORRECT PINYIN FORMAT:
- 猴子 → hóuzi (WRONG - no space)
- 你好 → nǐhǎo (WRONG - no space)
- 星期六 → xīngqīliù (WRONG - no spaces)

THE RULE: Count Chinese characters, count pinyin syllables - they MUST match!

EXAMPLE ROW:
chinese,pinyin,english,spanish,french,portuguese,vietnamese,thai,khmer,indonesian,malay,filipino
你好,nǐ hǎo,hello,hola,bonjour,olá,xin chào,สวัสดี,ជំរាបសួរ,halo,halo,kumusta

WORKFLOW:
1. Read Chinese_Combined_Words from each pack in the Overview
2. For each word, create translations in all 12 languages
3. Ensure pinyin has 1 syllable per character with spaces
4. Save as ChineseWords{pack_number}.csv
5. Run the pinyin validation script to verify character-syllable matching
