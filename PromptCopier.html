WORDPACK CONSTRUCTION PIPELINE - DOCUMENTATION FOR LLMs AND HUMANS
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEM:
-----------------------
This is a multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality
language learning flashcard data. The goal is to create vocabulary wordpacks
for a flashcard game that teaches Chinese, Spanish, and English.

THE ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP:
---------------------------
Each stage follows the same iterative pattern:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                                 │
    │   1. LLM Agent reviews current state                           │
    │   2. LLM scores quality (1-10) and lists improvements          │
    │   3. LLM makes changes                                         │
    │   4. Python scripts validate (duplicates, format, etc.)        │
    │   5. LLM fixes any Python-detected issues                      │
    │   6. LLM scores again                                          │
    │   7. If score < 9, feed to NEW LLM instance (unbiased)         │
    │   8. New LLM rates, suggests improvements                      │
    │   9. Repeat until score >= 9.0 or 9.5                          │
    │                                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WHY USE PYTHON FOR VALIDATION?
------------------------------
Python scripts are used for simple logic checks because:
- Code is faster than LLM for counting, string matching, duplicate detection
- LLMs have limited attention and consume tokens on repetitive checks
- Python catches 100% of format errors; LLMs might miss some
- Frees LLM to focus on creative/semantic work (quality of content)

Python validation scripts in PythonHelpers/:
- check_base_word_duplicates.py    - Stage 1: No base word in multiple packs
- check_combined_across_packs.py   - Stage 2+: Check combined array duplicates
- check_combined_duplicates.py     - Stage 2: Within-pack duplicate check
- validate_pinyin.py               - Stage 3+: Character-by-character pinyin mapping
- validate_overview_csvs.py        - General: CSV structure validation

THE 4 STAGES:
-------------
Stage 1: BASE WORDS REVIEW
    - Input:  [Lang]_Base_Words column in Overview CSV
    - Output: Perfected base vocabulary items (single words/compound words)
    - Goal:   Each pack has ~15-20 excellent themed vocabulary items
    - Check:  No duplicates across packs (each word in ONE pack only)

Stage 2: EXAMPLE WORDS CREATION
    - Input:  Finalized Base_Words from Stage 1
    - Output: [Lang]_Example_Words column (2 examples per base word)
    - Goal:   Examples that CONTAIN the base word, showing context
    - Check:  Every example contains its base word as substring

Stage 3: BREAKOUT CSV CREATION
    - Input:  Combined_Words (Base + Example merged)
    - Output: Individual CSV files per pack (e.g., ChineseWords1.csv)
    - Goal:   Full translations in all target languages
    - Check:  Character-by-character pinyin mapping (punctuation attached)

Stage 4: JAVASCRIPT MODULE GENERATION
    - Input:  Breakout CSVs (ChineseWords1.csv, etc.)
    - Output: JS modules in two formats:
              * Clean: Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js (readable, for development)
              * Obfuscated: Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js (compressed, for production)
    - Goal:   Game-ready data that can be imported by the flashcard app

CRITICAL RULE - PYTHON VS MANUAL EDITING:
-----------------------------------------
Python scripts are ONLY for FINDING issues, NEVER for fixing them.
- Python: Detect duplicates, count mismatches, format errors
- Manual: Actually edit the CSV to fix the issues

EXCEPTION: Combined_Words column is created by Python.
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (simple array concatenation).
This is deterministic computation, not a "fix" - there's no judgment involved.

Why manual fixes for everything else? Python can make automated changes
that cascade into bigger problems. Human/LLM must understand what
they're changing and why.

JAVASCRIPT MODULE STRUCTURE:
----------------------------
The final output is JavaScript modules organized by "Acts" (learning stages).

CLEAN VERSION (for development, LLM-assisted coding):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js
    Format: Human-readable ES6 exports

    export const p1_1_greetings__goodbyes = {
      meta: {
        wordpack: 1,
        english: "Greetings & Goodbyes",
        chinese: "问候语",
        spanish: "Saludos y Despedidas",
        // ... other language titles
      },
      words: [
        ["你好", "nǐ hǎo", "hello", "hola", "bonjour", ...],
        ["再见", "zài jiàn", "goodbye", "adiós", "au revoir", ...],
        // ... more words
      ]
    };

OBFUSCATED VERSION (for production deployment):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js
    Format: Compressed + Base64 encoded

    Obfuscation method (3 layers):
    1. JSON.stringify the data
    2. Reverse the string (salt)
    3. Zlib compress
    4. Base64 encode

    To decode (in browser):
    - Import module (contains base64 string in 'w' export)
    - Base64 decode → Uint8Array
    - pako.inflate (zlib decompress)
    - Reverse string
    - JSON.parse → original data

COLUMN STRUCTURE BY LANGUAGE:
-----------------------------
CHINESE (6 columns):
    [0] chinese, [1] pinyin, [2] english, [3] spanish, [4] french,
    [5] portuguese

SPANISH (5 columns):
    [0] spanish, [1] english, [2] chinese, [3] pinyin, [4] portuguese

ENGLISH (5 columns):
    [0] english, [1] chinese, [2] pinyin, [3] spanish, [4] portuguese

PINYIN CRITICAL RULE:
---------------------
Each Chinese character (with trailing punctuation) must map to exactly ONE pinyin syllable (with same punctuation).
This allows the game UI to display pinyin directly under each character.

    CORRECT:   猴子 → "hóu zi"    (2 chars = 2 syllables)
    INCORRECT: 猴子 → "hóuzi"     (2 chars but 1 syllable - WRONG)

ACTS (Learning Progression):
----------------------------
Words are grouped into "Acts" representing learning stages:
    - Act I: Foundation (basic vocabulary)
    - Act II: Building Blocks / Development
    - Act III: Daily Life / Expansion
    - Act IV: Expanding Expression / Mastery
    - Act V: Advanced / Refinement
    - Act VI: Advanced Constructs (Spanish only)
    - Act VII: Mastery Fluency (Spanish only)

Each act contains multiple wordpacks (e.g., Act I might have packs 1-50).

QUALITY STANDARDS:
------------------
- Stage 1 score target: 9.0+ (base words are excellent vocabulary items)
- Stage 2 score target: 9.0+ (examples naturally contain base words)
- Stage 3 score target: 9.5+ (translations accurate, pinyin correct)
- Overall: Keep iterating until a fresh LLM instance rates it highly

THE FRESH LLM PRINCIPLE:
------------------------
After making improvements, always have a NEW LLM instance (one that has never
seen this wordpack before) rate the quality. This prevents:
- Confirmation bias (the editing LLM thinking its changes are good)
- Anchoring (being influenced by previous versions)
- Familiarity blindness (missing issues due to repeated exposure)

<h1>Wordpack Construction Pipeline</h1>

<div>
    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    <p>A multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality flashcard data for language learning (Chinese, Spanish, English).</p>

    <h4>The Iterative Quality Loop</h4>
    <p>Each stage follows: <strong>LLM reviews → scores 1-10 → makes changes → Python validates → fixes issues → scores again → if &lt;9, new LLM rates → repeat until 9+</strong></p>

    <h4>Why Python + LLM?</h4>
    <p>Python handles mechanical checks (duplicates, format, counting) quickly and accurately. LLMs focus on creative/semantic work (is this a good vocabulary word for this theme?).</p>

    <h4>Final Output</h4>
    <p>JavaScript modules in 2 formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Jsmodules/*.js</code> - Clean, readable (for development)</li>
        <li><code>Jsmodules-js/*-js.js</code> - Obfuscated/compressed (for production)</li>

<h3>Chinese - Stage 1</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Review and perfect Chinese_Base_Words in ChineseWordsOverview.csv

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes
4. Run Python validation
5. Fix any issues Python finds
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, your output will be reviewed by a fresh LLM instance

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher (as rated by a fresh LLM that hasn't seen this before)

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

=== WHAT ARE BASE WORDS? ===
Base words are VOCABULARY ITEMS - single words or compound words that learners memorize.
Examples of GOOD base words: 你好, 星期六, 电脑, 谢谢, 早上好

Base words are NOT phrases, sentences, or words with added context.
- ✗ 我说你好 (phrase/sentence - NOT a base word)
- ✗ 他的电脑 (adds context - NOT a base word)
- ✓ 你好 (vocabulary item - GOOD)
- ✓ 电脑 (vocabulary item - GOOD)

=== CONTEXT COMES IN STAGE 2 - NOT NOW ===
Stage 2 creates Example_Words showing base words in context.
Your job in Stage 1 is ONLY to ensure base words are good vocabulary items.

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Does each base word fit the pack's theme?
- Are these useful vocabulary items learners should know?
- Are there duplicates or too-similar words within the pack?
- Are there obvious missing words for this theme?
- Is the difficulty appropriate for the pack's Act?

=== DO NOT ===
- Turn base words into phrases or sentences
- Add context to base words
- Worry about "lack of context" - that's Stage 2's job

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文) - NEVER Traditional Chinese
- Keep base words as vocabulary items (not phrases)
- You CAN add/remove/replace base words freely
- Roughly 15-20 words per pack is typical but very flexible

=== NO DUPLICATES ACROSS PACKS ===
After changes, run: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
Each base word must appear in ONLY ONE pack across all 107 packs.
If duplicates found, MANUALLY decide which pack fits best and MANUALLY remove from others.

=== CRITICAL: PYTHON = FIND, MANUAL = FIX ===
Python scripts ONLY find issues. They NEVER fix them.
YOU must MANUALLY edit the CSV to fix any issues Python finds.
NEVER use Python to automatically edit CSV files.

=== IDENTIFY GAPS ===
Note if obvious theme gaps deserve new packs.
Example: "Gap: No kitchen vocabulary. Suggest Pack 'Kitchen Items': [锅, 碗, 筷子, 勺子, ...]"

=== FILE INFO ===
FILE: ChineseWordsOverview.csv
COLUMN: Chinese_Base_Words

(See HTML tables above for before/after examples)

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current base words 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: Add/remove/replace vocabulary items
3. PYTHON CHECK: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
4. FIX: Remove any cross-pack duplicates
5. GAPS: Suggest new packs if themes missing
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements
7. If score < 9.0, explain what would make it 9.0+

=== FINAL OUTPUT (REQUIRED) ===
End your response with this exact table format:

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| BEFORE Score | X/10  |
| AFTER Score  | X/10  |
| Reason       | [1-2 sentence explanation of what improved] |

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes MANUALLY (⛔ NO PYTHON!)
4. Run Python validation for duplicates in Combined_Words
5. Fix any issues MANUALLY
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, iterate until quality is excellent

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

If Chinese_Example_Words column is EMPTY, this is the first run.
You must fill it out. Do not skip.

=== MOST IMPORTANT: CAREFULLY CURATED EXAMPLES ===
Examples are NOT random phrases that happen to contain the base word.
Examples are PRECIOUS TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES - treat each one as a chance to maximize learning!

⛔ AVOID MECHANICAL PATTERNS like:
- "小X" for everything (小猫, 小狗, 小鸟... boring and wastes learning opportunities)
- "very + adjective" for every adjective
- "I like X" for every noun
These patterns are lazy and squander the chance to teach useful, real phrases.

✅ INSTEAD, ask yourself for EACH example:
- "What's the MOST USEFUL phrase containing this word that a learner should know?"
- "What phrase will they actually hear or need to say in real life?"
- "Am I teaching something valuable, or just filling a slot?"

Examples must be CAREFULLY CURATED for maximum learning value:
- CONSIDER THE WORDPACK THEME: Look at Pack_Title and Base_Words to understand the theme
- Use examples that REINFORCE the theme (e.g., "Animals" pack → animal-related contexts)
- Use the MOST COMMON phrases a native speaker would actually say
- Choose phrases learners will encounter in real life
- Avoid obscure, literary, or rarely-used expressions
- Each example is a PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY to teach something maximally useful!

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Are examples PRECIOUS TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES (not mechanical patterns)?
- Do examples FIT THE WORDPACK THEME? (check Pack_Title and Base_Words)
- Are examples the MOST USEFUL phrases for each base word?
- Would a native speaker actually say these phrases?
- Are examples things learners will encounter in real life?
- Does each example clearly demonstrate the base word's usage?
- Are there any duplicates within or across packs?

=== YOUR GOAL ===
For each base word, create 2 CAREFULLY CHOSEN example phrases that CONTAIN that base word.
Each example MUST CONTAIN its base word as a substring.

=== ⛔ NO PYTHON FOR GENERATION ===
Do NOT write Python. Do NOT automate. Type each example by hand.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
1. SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文)
2. Each base word → exactly 2 examples
3. Each example MUST CONTAIN the base word
4. Examples should be the MOST COMMON, USEFUL phrases
5. ⛔ NO PYTHON - MANUAL ONLY

=== STRUCTURE ===
Base_Words: [词1, 词2, 词3]
Example_Words: [词1例A, 词1例B, 词2例A, 词2例B, 词3例A, 词3例B]

=== EXAMPLE ===
Base_Words: [你好, 再见]
Example_Words: [你好吗, 你好啊, 再见朋友, 再见了]

=== COMBINED_WORDS DUPLICATE CHECK (MANDATORY!) ===
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (created automatically by Python).

⛔ ZERO DUPLICATES ALLOWED:
- No duplicate within a single pack's Combined_Words
- No duplicate ACROSS different packs' Combined_Words
- If Pack 1 has "你好吗", NO OTHER PACK can have "你好吗"

This is NOT optional. Duplicates across packs = FAILED.

Run these scripts to CHECK (not fix):
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_duplicates.py
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_across_packs.py chinese
python PythonHelpers/validate_overview_csvs.py

These scripts ONLY find issues. They do NOT fix anything.
If duplicates found, YOU must MANUALLY fix your Example_Words.
Keep iterating until the checker reports ZERO duplicates.

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current examples 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: ⛔ MANUALLY create/improve examples (NO PYTHON!)
3. PYTHON CHECK: Run duplicate check scripts (checking only)
4. FIX: MANUALLY fix any duplicates in Example_Words
5. REPEAT steps 3-4 until ZERO duplicates across all packs
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements

=== ⛔ FINAL WARNING ===
- If you write Python to generate examples = FAILED.
- If you edit Base_Words = FAILED.

   - Would a NATIVE SPEAKER use this exact phrasing?
   - Is this NATURAL everyday language (not formal/technical)?

4. If translation is not the BEST → Record fix in ChineseFixTableAct1.csv

   - Would a NATIVE SPEAKER use this exact phrasing?
   - Is this NATURAL everyday language (not formal/technical)?

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

=== STEP 2: RECORD FIXES IN ACT-SPECIFIC FIX TABLE ===

For EVERY issue found, add a row to:
EnglishWords/EnglishFixTableAct5.csv

Format:
Language,Pack_Number,Pack_Title,Row_Number,Column_Name,Old_Value,New_Value,Reason

Example:
english,131,Pack Title,3,english,salutation,hello,Too formal - use common word

🔒 NEVER edit Column 0 (english) - it's sacred!
✓ Theme matching: Translation must fit the pack's theme
✓ Natural phrasing: Most common everyday translation

=== STEP 3: APPLY FIXES (MANDATORY!) ===

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ⚠️⚠️⚠️ FIX TABLE IS USELESS WITHOUT RUNNING APPLY! ⚠️⚠️⚠️      ║
║                                                                  ║
║  The fix table is INTERMEDIATE. Task FAILS if not applied!      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes_by_act.py english 5

If errors occur:
- Check Row_Numbers (header = row 1, data starts row 2)
- Check Old_Values match exactly what's in the CSV
- Fix the fix table and rerun

=== STEP 4: VALIDATE ===

python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py english 131 160

Expected: 0 errors

=== STEP 5: COMMIT ===

git add EnglishWords/EnglishWords{1..160}.csv EnglishWords/EnglishFixTableAct5.csv
git commit -m "Act 5/5 (Advanced Mastery): Review and fix translations for packs 131-160"
git push -u origin <branch>

=== SUCCESS CHECKLIST ===

✅ All 25 packs manually reviewed (not just Python-flagged ones)
✅ EnglishFixTableAct5.csv has all fixes recorded
✅ ⚠️  apply_fixes_by_act.py ran successfully (MANDATORY!)
✅ Actual CSV files are CHANGED (not just fix table)
✅ Validation passes
✅ Committed and pushed

⚠️⚠️⚠️ If actual CSVs aren't fixed, you FAILED! ⚠️⚠️⚠️</div>


<h3>All Languages - Stage 4 (Single Prompt)</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Generate JavaScript modules from ALL breakout CSVs (Chinese, Spanish, English)

=== THIS IS SIMPLE - JUST RUN THE SCRIPTS ===
Stage 4 is straightforward: run Python scripts to convert CSVs to JS modules.
No manual editing needed. Scripts do all the work.

=== STEP 1: RUN ALL THREE CONVERSION SCRIPTS ===
python ChineseWords/ChineseWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py
python SpanishWords/SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py
python EnglishWords/EnglishWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py

Each script:
- Reads breakout CSVs ([Lang]Words1.csv, [Lang]Words2.csv, ...)
- Groups packs into acts based on Overview CSV
- Outputs CLEAN JS: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules/act{N}-{name}.js
- Outputs OBFUSCATED JS: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules-js/act{N}-{name}-js.js

=== STEP 2: UPDATE LINK.txt ===
python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

This updates LINK.txt with all the new JS module URLs.

=== STEP 3: VERIFY (OPTIONAL) ===
Open DecoderTest.html in browser to confirm modules decode correctly.

=== STEP 4: COMMIT AND PR ===
git add .
git commit -m "Regenerate JS modules for all languages"
git push

=== WHAT THE SCRIPTS PRODUCE ===

CHINESE (107 packs → 5 acts, 6 columns):
- Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js ... act5-refinement.js
- Columns: chinese, pinyin, english, spanish, french, portuguese

SPANISH (250 packs → 7 acts, 5 columns):
- Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js ... act7-mastery-fluency.js
- Columns: spanish, english, chinese, pinyin, portuguese

ENGLISH (160 packs → 5 acts, 5 columns):
- Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js ... act5-advanced-mastery.js
- Columns: english, chinese, pinyin, spanish, portuguese

=== JS MODULE STRUCTURE (all languages same format) ===
export const p{act}_{pack}_{title} = {
  meta: {
    wordpack: 1,           // Pack number (integer)
    english: "Title",      // Title translations
    chinese: "标题",
    // ... other languages
  },
  words: [
    ["word1_col1", "word1_col2", ...],
    ["word2_col1", "word2_col2", ...],
  ]
};

=== OBFUSCATION (handled automatically) ===
Obfuscated files use: JSON → reverse → zlib compress → base64
Decoded in browser with pako.js (see DecoderTest.html)

=== FINAL OUTPUT (REQUIRED) ===
| Metric    | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Chinese   | ✓ Generated (X acts) |
| Spanish   | ✓ Generated (X acts) |
| English   | ✓ Generated (X acts) |
| LINK.txt  | ✓ Updated |

<h3>Fresh LLM Rating Prompt</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Rate the quality of wordpack data (UNBIASED REVIEW)

=== IMPORTANT ===
You are rating work done by another LLM agent. You have NOT seen this data before.
Provide an honest, unbiased assessment. Do not assume the work is good.

=== WHAT TO RATE ===
Rate each aspect 1-10 and provide an OVERALL score.

For BASE WORDS (Stage 1):
- Theme fit: Do words match the pack's stated theme?
- Usefulness: Are these words learners should know?
- Completeness: Are obvious words missing?
- No phrases: Are all entries vocabulary items (not sentences)?
- No duplicates: Each word appears in only one pack?

For EXAMPLE WORDS (Stage 2):
- Contains base word: Does each example contain its base word?
- Natural usage: Are examples phrases people actually say?
- Variety: Are the 2 examples per word different enough?
- Correct count: Exactly 2 examples per base word?

For TRANSLATIONS (Stage 3):
- Accuracy: Are translations correct?
- Pinyin format: Character-by-character mapping, punctuation attached?
- Simplified Chinese: No Traditional characters?
- Consistency: Same quality across all rows?

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Theme Fit: X/10 - [brief comment]
Usefulness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Completeness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Format Correctness: X/10 - [brief comment]
...

OVERALL SCORE: X/10

SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND:
1. [Issue and how to fix]
2. [Issue and how to fix]
...

VERDICT: [PASS if >= 9.0] or [NEEDS IMPROVEMENT if < 9.0]

=== BE HONEST ===
If the work is excellent, say so. If it has problems, list them clearly.
The goal is quality, not politeness.</div>
