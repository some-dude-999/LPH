WORDPACK CONSTRUCTION PIPELINE - DOCUMENTATION FOR LLMs AND HUMANS
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEM:
-----------------------
This is a multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality
language learning flashcard data. The goal is to create vocabulary wordpacks
for a flashcard game that teaches Chinese, Spanish, and English.

THE ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP:
---------------------------
Each stage follows the same iterative pattern:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                                 │
    │   1. LLM Agent reviews current state                           │
    │   2. LLM scores quality (1-10) and lists improvements          │
    │   3. LLM makes changes                                         │
    │   4. Python scripts validate (duplicates, format, etc.)        │
    │   5. LLM fixes any Python-detected issues                      │
    │   6. LLM scores again                                          │
    │   7. If score < 9, feed to NEW LLM instance (unbiased)         │
    │   8. New LLM rates, suggests improvements                      │
    │   9. Repeat until score >= 9.0 or 9.5                          │
    │                                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WHY USE PYTHON FOR VALIDATION?
------------------------------
Python scripts are used for simple logic checks because:
- Code is faster than LLM for counting, string matching, duplicate detection
- LLMs have limited attention and consume tokens on repetitive checks
- Python catches 100% of format errors; LLMs might miss some
- Frees LLM to focus on creative/semantic work (quality of content)

Python validation scripts in PythonHelpers/:
- check_base_word_duplicates.py    - Stage 1: No base word in multiple packs
- check_combined_across_packs.py   - Stage 2+: Check combined array duplicates
- check_combined_duplicates.py     - Stage 2: Within-pack duplicate check
- validate_pinyin.py               - Stage 3+: Character-by-character pinyin mapping
- validate_overview_csvs.py        - General: CSV structure validation

THE 4 STAGES:
-------------
Stage 1: BASE WORDS REVIEW
    - Input:  [Lang]_Base_Words column in Overview CSV
    - Output: Perfected base vocabulary items (single words/compound words)
    - Goal:   Each pack has ~15-20 excellent themed vocabulary items
    - Check:  No duplicates across packs (each word in ONE pack only)

Stage 2: EXAMPLE WORDS CREATION
    - Input:  Finalized Base_Words from Stage 1
    - Output: [Lang]_Example_Words column (2 examples per base word)
    - Goal:   Examples that CONTAIN the base word, showing context
    - Check:  Every example contains its base word as substring

Stage 3: BREAKOUT CSV CREATION
    - Input:  Combined_Words (Base + Example merged)
    - Output: Individual CSV files per pack (e.g., ChineseWords1.csv)
    - Goal:   Full translations in all target languages
    - Check:  Character-by-character pinyin mapping (punctuation attached)

Stage 4: JAVASCRIPT MODULE GENERATION
    - Input:  Breakout CSVs (ChineseWords1.csv, etc.)
    - Output: JS modules in two formats:
              * Clean: Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js (readable, for development)
              * Obfuscated: Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js (compressed, for production)
    - Goal:   Game-ready data that can be imported by the flashcard app

CRITICAL RULE - PYTHON VS MANUAL EDITING:
-----------------------------------------
Python scripts are ONLY for FINDING issues, NEVER for fixing them.
- Python: Detect duplicates, count mismatches, format errors
- Manual: Actually edit the CSV to fix the issues

EXCEPTION: Combined_Words column is created by Python.
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (simple array concatenation).
This is deterministic computation, not a "fix" - there's no judgment involved.

Why manual fixes for everything else? Python can make automated changes
that cascade into bigger problems. Human/LLM must understand what
they're changing and why.

JAVASCRIPT MODULE STRUCTURE:
----------------------------
The final output is JavaScript modules organized by "Acts" (learning stages).

CLEAN VERSION (for development, LLM-assisted coding):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js
    Format: Human-readable ES6 exports

    export const p1_1_greetings__goodbyes = {
      meta: {
        wordpack: 1,
        english: "Greetings & Goodbyes",
        chinese: "问候语",
        spanish: "Saludos y Despedidas",
        // ... other language titles
      },
      words: [
        ["你好", "nǐ hǎo", "hello", "hola", "bonjour", ...],
        ["再见", "zài jiàn", "goodbye", "adiós", "au revoir", ...],
        // ... more words
      ]
    };

OBFUSCATED VERSION (for production deployment):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js
    Format: Compressed + Base64 encoded

    Obfuscation method (3 layers):
    1. JSON.stringify the data
    2. Reverse the string (salt)
    3. Zlib compress
    4. Base64 encode

    To decode (in browser):
    - Import module (contains base64 string in 'w' export)
    - Base64 decode → Uint8Array
    - pako.inflate (zlib decompress)
    - Reverse string
    - JSON.parse → original data

COLUMN STRUCTURE BY LANGUAGE:
-----------------------------
CHINESE (6 columns):
    [0] chinese, [1] pinyin, [2] english, [3] spanish, [4] french,
    [5] portuguese

SPANISH (5 columns):
    [0] spanish, [1] english, [2] chinese, [3] pinyin, [4] portuguese

ENGLISH (5 columns):
    [0] english, [1] chinese, [2] pinyin, [3] spanish, [4] portuguese

PINYIN CRITICAL RULE:
---------------------
Each Chinese character (with trailing punctuation) must map to exactly ONE pinyin syllable (with same punctuation).
This allows the game UI to display pinyin directly under each character.

    CORRECT:   猴子 → "hóu zi"    (2 chars = 2 syllables)
    INCORRECT: 猴子 → "hóuzi"     (2 chars but 1 syllable - WRONG)

ACTS (Learning Progression):
----------------------------
Words are grouped into "Acts" representing learning stages:
    - Act I: Foundation (basic vocabulary)
    - Act II: Building Blocks / Development
    - Act III: Daily Life / Expansion
    - Act IV: Expanding Expression / Mastery
    - Act V: Advanced / Refinement
    - Act VI: Advanced Constructs (Spanish only)
    - Act VII: Mastery Fluency (Spanish only)

Each act contains multiple wordpacks (e.g., Act I might have packs 1-50).

QUALITY STANDARDS:
------------------
- Stage 1 score target: 9.0+ (base words are excellent vocabulary items)
- Stage 2 score target: 9.0+ (examples naturally contain base words)
- Stage 3 score target: 9.5+ (translations accurate, pinyin correct)
- Overall: Keep iterating until a fresh LLM instance rates it highly

THE FRESH LLM PRINCIPLE:
------------------------
After making improvements, always have a NEW LLM instance (one that has never
seen this wordpack before) rate the quality. This prevents:
- Confirmation bias (the editing LLM thinking its changes are good)
- Anchoring (being influenced by previous versions)
- Familiarity blindness (missing issues due to repeated exposure)

<h1>Wordpack Construction Pipeline</h1>

<div>
    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    <p>A multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality flashcard data for language learning (Chinese, Spanish, English).</p>

    <h4>The Iterative Quality Loop</h4>
    <p>Each stage follows: <strong>LLM reviews → scores 1-10 → makes changes → Python validates → fixes issues → scores again → if &lt;9, new LLM rates → repeat until 9+</strong></p>

    <h4>Why Python + LLM?</h4>
    <p>Python handles mechanical checks (duplicates, format, counting) quickly and accurately. LLMs focus on creative/semantic work (is this a good vocabulary word for this theme?).</p>

    <h4>Final Output</h4>
    <p>JavaScript modules in 2 formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Jsmodules/*.js</code> - Clean, readable (for development)</li>
        <li><code>Jsmodules-js/*-js.js</code> - Obfuscated/compressed (for production)</li>

<h3>Chinese - Stage 1</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Review and perfect Chinese_Base_Words in ChineseWordsOverview.csv

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes
4. Run Python validation
5. Fix any issues Python finds
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, your output will be reviewed by a fresh LLM instance

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher (as rated by a fresh LLM that hasn't seen this before)

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

=== WHAT ARE BASE WORDS? ===
Base words are VOCABULARY ITEMS - single words or compound words that learners memorize.
Examples of GOOD base words: 你好, 星期六, 电脑, 谢谢, 早上好

Base words are NOT phrases, sentences, or words with added context.
- ✗ 我说你好 (phrase/sentence - NOT a base word)
- ✗ 他的电脑 (adds context - NOT a base word)
- ✓ 你好 (vocabulary item - GOOD)
- ✓ 电脑 (vocabulary item - GOOD)

=== CONTEXT COMES IN STAGE 2 - NOT NOW ===
Stage 2 creates Example_Words showing base words in context.
Your job in Stage 1 is ONLY to ensure base words are good vocabulary items.

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Does each base word fit the pack's theme?
- Are these useful vocabulary items learners should know?
- Are there duplicates or too-similar words within the pack?
- Are there obvious missing words for this theme?
- Is the difficulty appropriate for the pack's Act?

=== DO NOT ===
- Turn base words into phrases or sentences
- Add context to base words
- Worry about "lack of context" - that's Stage 2's job

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文) - NEVER Traditional Chinese
- Keep base words as vocabulary items (not phrases)
- You CAN add/remove/replace base words freely
- Roughly 15-20 words per pack is typical but very flexible

=== NO DUPLICATES ACROSS PACKS ===
After changes, run: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
Each base word must appear in ONLY ONE pack across all 107 packs.
If duplicates found, MANUALLY decide which pack fits best and MANUALLY remove from others.

=== CRITICAL: PYTHON = FIND, MANUAL = FIX ===
Python scripts ONLY find issues. They NEVER fix them.
YOU must MANUALLY edit the CSV to fix any issues Python finds.
NEVER use Python to automatically edit CSV files.

=== IDENTIFY GAPS ===
Note if obvious theme gaps deserve new packs.
Example: "Gap: No kitchen vocabulary. Suggest Pack 'Kitchen Items': [锅, 碗, 筷子, 勺子, ...]"

=== FILE INFO ===
FILE: ChineseWordsOverview.csv
COLUMN: Chinese_Base_Words

(See HTML tables above for before/after examples)

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current base words 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: Add/remove/replace vocabulary items
3. PYTHON CHECK: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
4. FIX: Remove any cross-pack duplicates
5. GAPS: Suggest new packs if themes missing
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements
7. If score < 9.0, explain what would make it 9.0+

=== FINAL OUTPUT (REQUIRED) ===
End your response with this exact table format:

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| BEFORE Score | X/10  |
| AFTER Score  | X/10  |
| Reason       | [1-2 sentence explanation of what improved] |

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes MANUALLY (⛔ NO PYTHON!)
4. Run Python validation for duplicates in Combined_Words
5. Fix any issues MANUALLY
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, iterate until quality is excellent

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

If Chinese_Example_Words column is EMPTY, this is the first run.
You must fill it out. Do not skip.

=== MOST IMPORTANT: CAREFULLY CURATED EXAMPLES ===
Examples are NOT random phrases that happen to contain the base word.
Examples are PRECIOUS TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES - treat each one as a chance to maximize learning!

⛔ AVOID MECHANICAL PATTERNS like:
- "小X" for everything (小猫, 小狗, 小鸟... boring and wastes learning opportunities)
- "very + adjective" for every adjective
- "I like X" for every noun
These patterns are lazy and squander the chance to teach useful, real phrases.

✅ INSTEAD, ask yourself for EACH example:
- "What's the MOST USEFUL phrase containing this word that a learner should know?"
- "What phrase will they actually hear or need to say in real life?"
- "Am I teaching something valuable, or just filling a slot?"

Examples must be CAREFULLY CURATED for maximum learning value:
- CONSIDER THE WORDPACK THEME: Look at Pack_Title and Base_Words to understand the theme
- Use examples that REINFORCE the theme (e.g., "Animals" pack → animal-related contexts)
- Use the MOST COMMON phrases a native speaker would actually say
- Choose phrases learners will encounter in real life
- Avoid obscure, literary, or rarely-used expressions
- Each example is a PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY to teach something maximally useful!

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Are examples PRECIOUS TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES (not mechanical patterns)?
- Do examples FIT THE WORDPACK THEME? (check Pack_Title and Base_Words)
- Are examples the MOST USEFUL phrases for each base word?
- Would a native speaker actually say these phrases?
- Are examples things learners will encounter in real life?
- Does each example clearly demonstrate the base word's usage?
- Are there any duplicates within or across packs?

=== YOUR GOAL ===
For each base word, create 2 CAREFULLY CHOSEN example phrases that CONTAIN that base word.
Each example MUST CONTAIN its base word as a substring.

=== ⛔ NO PYTHON FOR GENERATION ===
Do NOT write Python. Do NOT automate. Type each example by hand.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
1. SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文)
2. Each base word → exactly 2 examples
3. Each example MUST CONTAIN the base word
4. Examples should be the MOST COMMON, USEFUL phrases
5. ⛔ NO PYTHON - MANUAL ONLY

=== STRUCTURE ===
Base_Words: [词1, 词2, 词3]
Example_Words: [词1例A, 词1例B, 词2例A, 词2例B, 词3例A, 词3例B]

=== EXAMPLE ===
Base_Words: [你好, 再见]
Example_Words: [你好吗, 你好啊, 再见朋友, 再见了]

=== COMBINED_WORDS DUPLICATE CHECK (MANDATORY!) ===
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (created automatically by Python).

⛔ ZERO DUPLICATES ALLOWED:
- No duplicate within a single pack's Combined_Words
- No duplicate ACROSS different packs' Combined_Words
- If Pack 1 has "你好吗", NO OTHER PACK can have "你好吗"

This is NOT optional. Duplicates across packs = FAILED.

Run these scripts to CHECK (not fix):
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_duplicates.py
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_across_packs.py chinese
python PythonHelpers/validate_overview_csvs.py

These scripts ONLY find issues. They do NOT fix anything.
If duplicates found, YOU must MANUALLY fix your Example_Words.
Keep iterating until the checker reports ZERO duplicates.

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current examples 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: ⛔ MANUALLY create/improve examples (NO PYTHON!)
3. PYTHON CHECK: Run duplicate check scripts (checking only)
4. FIX: MANUALLY fix any duplicates in Example_Words
5. REPEAT steps 3-4 until ZERO duplicates across all packs
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements

=== ⛔ FINAL WARNING ===
- If you write Python to generate examples = FAILED.
- If you edit Base_Words = FAILED.
- If duplicates exist across packs after your changes = FAILED.

=== STEP 0A: TRIM SPACES (ALWAYS RUN FIRST!) ===

python PythonHelpers/trim_csv_spaces.py chinese
   → Removes leading/trailing spaces from ALL cells
   → Turns "some text   " into "some text"
   → Run this BEFORE all other validation!

=== STEP 0B: PYTHON VALIDATION (6 SCRIPTS - MECHANICAL ERROR DETECTION) ===

Run ALL 6 validation scripts to catch mechanical errors:

1. python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py chinese
   → Character-by-character pinyin mapping
   → Prevents "?" appearing in DecoderTest.html
   → Catches: nǐhǎo (wrong) vs nǐ hǎo (correct)
   → Catches: hǎo ， (wrong) vs hǎo， (correct - punctuation attached)
   → Catches: ATM jī (wrong) vs A T M jī (correct - letter-by-letter)

2. python PythonHelpers/check_translation_quality.py chinese
   → Brackets [  ] in cells (failed auto-translation)
   → Empty translation cells

3. python PythonHelpers/check_language_mismatch.py chinese
   → Spanish text in Chinese column
   → Chinese characters in Spanish column
   → Wrong Unicode script in wrong column

4. python PythonHelpers/check_latin_in_chinese.py chinese
   → Illegitimate Latin in Chinese column
   → Catches: "la", "los", "el" (Spanish articles - NOT loanwords)
   → Allows: "ATM", "DNA", "WiFi" (legitimate Chinese loanwords)

5. python PythonHelpers/check_punctuation.py chinese
   → Flags ALL symbols/punctuation in ALL columns for manual review
   → ERROR: |, [, ], {}, <> (likely translation failures)
   → WARNING: ?, !, . (needs review)
   → INFO: All other punctuation (commas, quotes, accents, etc.)
   → Chinese comma placement - MUST match pinyin character-by-character
   → Catches: Chinese "是的，先生" but pinyin "shì de xiān shēng" (missing comma)

6. python PythonHelpers/verify_words_integrity.py chinese
   → Overview ↔ Breakout CSV sync
   → Row count mismatches
   → Accidentally added/deleted rows

⚠️ Python scripts flag mechanical errors. Note all flagged packs.
⚠️ BUT: Zero Python errors ≠ Zero issues! Manual review still required!


⚠️⚠️⚠️ SPANISH ARTICLES: SIMPLE TRANSLATION ONLY ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Spanish articles (el, la, los, las) → Just translate to "the"!

DO NOT use grammar terminology:
❌ el → 定冠词 (definite article) - THIS IS WRONG!
❌ el → 阳性定冠词 (masculine article) - THIS IS WRONG!
❌ the → the (masculine) - THIS IS WRONG!

CORRECT translation:
✅ el → the (English)
✅ el → 这/这个 (Chinese - "this" or context-appropriate)
✅ la → the (English)
✅ los → the (English - plural but still "the")
✅ las → the (English - plural but still "the")

These are VOCABULARY cards, not grammar lessons!
Users need SIMPLE, NATURAL translations to learn!

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Chinese Packs: ChineseWords1.csv through ChineseWords107.csv
Location: ChineseWords/ChineseWords{N}.csv

FOR EACH PACK, use Read tool: Read("ChineseWords/ChineseWords{N}.csv")

Then check EVERY ROW, EVERY COLUMN:
   - Column 0 (chinese): SACRED - Skip this. It's correct from Combined_Words.
   - Column 1 (pinyin): Character-by-character mapping? Correct tones? Punctuation attached correctly?
   - Column 2 (english): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?
   - Column 3 (spanish): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?
   - Column 4 (french): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?
   - Column 5 (portuguese): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?

⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE CRITICAL ISSUE: WRONG MEANINGS FROM AUTO-TRANSLATION ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Column 0 (chinese) is CORRECT - it came from Combined_Words validated in Stages 1-2.
The problem is: TRANSLATIONS (columns 1-5) may have the WRONG MEANING because
many words have multiple meanings depending on context!

EXAMPLE:
Pack: "Sports Equipment"
Column 0: 球拍 (racket) ← CORRECT word for theme (from Combined_Words)
Column 2 (english): "noise" ← WRONG! Auto-translator chose "racket = noise"
Column 2 SHOULD BE: "racket" (sports equipment) ← CORRECT meaning for theme!

ANOTHER EXAMPLE:
Pack: "Kitchen Utensils"
Column 0: 叉子 (fork) ← CORRECT word for theme (from Combined_Words)
Column 3 (spanish): "bifurcación" ← WRONG! (fork in road)
Column 3 SHOULD BE: "tenedor" ← CORRECT! (eating utensil)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER PINYIN MAPPING - CRITICAL! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

MAPPING RULE:
Each Chinese character (with trailing punctuation) → one pinyin syllable (with same punctuation)

✅ CORRECT EXAMPLE:
Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo， xiān shēng

Character-by-character breakdown:
早   → zǎo
上   → shàng
好， → hǎo，   (punctuation attached!)
先   → xiān
生   → shēng

❌ WRONG EXAMPLES:
Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo, xiān shēng  ❌ (Latin comma instead of Chinese comma)

Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo ， xiān shēng  ❌ (space before comma)

Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎoshànghǎo， xiān shēng  ❌ (missing spaces between syllables)

WHY: Pinyin displays directly under Chinese characters in the game.
Each character must map to exactly one syllable with matching punctuation.

RULE: Punctuation sticks to character → punctuation sticks to syllable
`好，` → `hǎo，` (not `hǎo ，` or `hǎo,`)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ LATIN TEXT IN CHINESE COLUMN - CRITICAL EVALUATION! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

NOT ALL Latin text in Chinese columns is acceptable! You must distinguish between:

✅ LEGITIMATE LOANWORDS (Used in actual Chinese):
   - Technology: DNA, ATM, GPS, NFT, USB, CD, DVD, WiFi, 5G, AI, VR
   - Brands/Apps: WhatsApp, iPhone, iPad, Uber, Tesla
   - Fashion: T恤 (T-shirt), T台 (runway), X光 (X-ray)
   - Common: OK, bye, email, app, web

   Examples:
   Chinese: ATM机      Pinyin: ATM jī       ✅ CORRECT (ATM is used in Chinese)
   Chinese: DNA测试     Pinyin: DNA cè shì   ✅ CORRECT (DNA is used in Chinese)
   Chinese: T恤        Pinyin: T xù         ✅ CORRECT (T is used in Chinese for T-shirt)
   Chinese: NFT        Pinyin: NFT          ✅ CORRECT (NFT is used in Chinese)

❌ TRANSLATION FAILURES (Must be fixed):
   - Spanish articles: la, los, el, las, un, una
   - Untranslated Spanish words that aren't Chinese loanwords
   - Any Latin text NOT in the legitimate loanword list

   Examples:
   Chinese: la         Pinyin: la           ❌ WRONG! (Spanish article, not Chinese)
   Chinese: los        Pinyin: los          ❌ WRONG! (Spanish article, not Chinese)
   Chinese: el         Pinyin: el           ❌ WRONG! (Spanish article, not Chinese)

HOW TO CHECK:
1. See Latin text in Chinese column? Ask: "Do Chinese speakers actually use this term?"
2. If it's a Spanish article (la, los, el, las, un, una) → ❌ TRANSLATION FAILURE
3. If it's NOT in the loanword list above → ❌ LIKELY TRANSLATION FAILURE
4. If unsure → Run: python PythonHelpers/check_latin_in_chinese.py chinese

⚠️⚠️⚠️ LATIN LETTERS IN CHINESE - CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

When Chinese contains Latin letters, each Latin LETTER maps to itself:

RULE: Latin letters map LETTER-BY-LETTER (A→A, T→T, M→M)

✅ CORRECT MAPPING:
Chinese: ATM机
Mapping: A → A,  T → T,  M → M,  机 → jī
Pinyin:  A T M jī            (each letter separate with spaces!)

Chinese: T恤
Mapping: T → T,  恤 → xù
Pinyin:  T xù                (letter T maps to itself)

Chinese: 在WhatsApp上
Mapping: 在→zài,  W→W, h→h, a→a, t→t, s→s, A→A, p→p, p→p,  上→shàng
Pinyin:  zài W h a t s A p p shàng   (each letter separate!)

❌ WRONG MAPPING:
Chinese: ATM机
Pinyin:  ATM jī              ❌ (ATM should be "A T M" - letter-by-letter!)

Chinese: 在WhatsApp上
Pinyin:  zài WhatsApp shàng  ❌ (WhatsApp should be "W h a t s A p p")

WHY: The game renders each character/letter in a separate block.
Latin letters must have spaces between them just like Chinese syllables.

QUALITY CHECK FOR EACH TRANSLATION:
□ Does the translation match the CORRECT MEANING for this pack's theme?
□ Did auto-translation pick the RIGHT definition of this word?
□ Is this the most COMMON way to say this? (not rare/formal)
□ Would a NATIVE SPEAKER actually use this phrase?
□ Is the grammar CORRECT?
□ Are special characters/accents CORRECT?
□ Character-by-character pinyin mapping with punctuation attached? (好，→ hǎo，)

SCORING SCALE:
  10 = Perfect (no issues at all - every translation is excellent)
  9  = Excellent (trivial issues only, acceptable as-is)
  8  = Good (minor issues that should be fixed)
  7  = Fair (several issues across translations)
  6 or below = Poor (significant issues, definitely needs work)

=== STEP 2: UPDATE SCORECARD (TranslationErrors.csv) ===

║  1. ChineseWordsTranslationErrors.csv (scorecard with Issue_Count) ║
║  2. ChineseFixTable.csv (surgical fixes for all issues)          ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

=== FILE 1: TranslationErrors.csv ===
The CSV has these columns:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pack_Number | Pack number (1-107) - DO NOT EDIT |
| Pack_Title | Title of the pack - DO NOT EDIT |
| Difficulty_Act | Act assignment - DO NOT EDIT |
| Issue_Count | NUMBER of issues found - FILL THIS IN |
| Issues | BRIEF SUMMARY of issues - FILL THIS IN |

=== FILE 2: ChineseFixTable.csv ===
For EACH issue you find, add a row to the fix table:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Language | "chinese" (pre-filled by init script) |
| Pack_Number | Pack number (pre-filled by init script) |
| Row_Number | Row number in breakout CSV (YOU FILL) |
| Column_Name | Column to fix (YOU FILL) |
| Old_Value | Current incorrect value (YOU FILL) |
| New_Value | Correct value (YOU FILL) |
| Reason | Why this fix is needed (YOU FILL) |

FOR EACH PACK (1-107):
1. Read the breakout CSV: ChineseWords/ChineseWords{N}.csv
2. Evaluate all translations carefully - BE EXTREMELY NITPICKY
3. Count issues and write brief summary in TranslationErrors.csv
4. For EACH issue, add a row to ChineseFixTable.csv with the fix details

=== STEP 3: APPLY FIXES (MANDATORY - NOT OPTIONAL!) ===

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE FIX TABLE IS USELESS WITHOUT RUNNING APPLY! ⚠️⚠️⚠️  ║
║                                                                  ║
║  The fix table is ONLY an intermediate artifact.                ║
║  TASK IS A TOTAL FAIL if you don't actually apply the fixes!    ║
║                                                                  ║
║  IMMEDIATELY after completing the fix table:                    ║
║  1. Run: python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py ChineseWords/ChineseFixTable.csv
║  2. If errors occur → debug and rerun until SUCCESS             ║
║  3. Final output = FIXED DATASET (actual CSV files changed)     ║
║                                                                  ║
║  DO NOT ask for review. DO NOT stop at the fix table.           ║
║  The job is NOT done until the CSVs are actually fixed!         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

APPLY WORKFLOW:
1. Run: python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py ChineseWords/ChineseFixTable.csv
2. Check output for mismatches or errors
3. If errors:
   - Debug: Are Row_Numbers correct? (Header = row 1, data starts row 2)
   - Debug: Do Old_Values match exactly what's in the CSV?
   - Fix the fix table and rerun
4. When apply succeeds with 0 mismatches → Validate and commit
5. Run validation: python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py chinese
6. Commit and PR to main

SURGICAL EDIT PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL!):
- Edits target specific: Language, Pack_Number, Row_Number, Column_Name
- NEVER blanket "replace A with B in all CSVs"
- Each fix must specify exact location: which pack, which row, which column
- Can fix 500 rows at once, but EACH must be surgically specified
- Even if the same error is in ALL rows of ALL packs, specify each one!

=== STEP 4: RE-VALIDATE + COMMIT ===

After apply_fixes.py runs successfully:

python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py chinese

Expected: 0 errors (all mechanical issues fixed)

Then commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Stage 3A: Comprehensive review + fixes for Chinese packs 1-107"
git push -u origin <branch-name>

=== STEP 5: DISPLAY SUMMARY ===

After updating both CSVs, display this summary:

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Packs with 0 issues | X |
| Packs with 1-5 issues | X |
| Packs with 6-10 issues | X |
| Packs with 11+ issues | X |
| TOTAL PACKS NEEDING FIXES (Issue_Count > 0) | X |
| TOTAL FIXES IN FIX TABLE | X |

=== FINAL OUTPUT CHECKLIST (ALL REQUIRED!) ===
| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| All 107 packs evaluated | ✓/✗ |
| TranslationErrors.csv: All Issue_Count filled | ✓/✗ |
| ChineseFixTable.csv: One row per issue | ✓/✗ |
| ⚠️ Fixes APPLIED with apply_fixes.py (MANDATORY!) | ✓/✗ |
| apply_fixes.py ran with 0 mismatches | ✓/✗ |
| Validation scripts pass | ✓/✗ |
| Changes committed and PRed | ✓/✗ |

⚠️⚠️⚠️ If "Fixes APPLIED" is ✗, you have FAILED THE TASK! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

=== PINYIN RULE REFERENCE ===
Each Chinese character (with trailing punctuation) = exactly ONE pinyin syllable (with same punctuation).
✓ CORRECT: 猴子 → hóu zi (2 chars = 2 syllables with space)
✗ WRONG: 猴子 → hóuzi (missing space!)

=== BREAKOUT CSV COLUMNS (6 columns) ===
| Col | Name       | Notes                        |
|-----|------------|------------------------------|
| 1   | chinese    | Must match Overview          |
| 2   | pinyin     | Char-by-char mapping (punctuation attached) |
| 3   | english    | Translation                  |

=== STEP 0: GENERATE ERROR SUMMARY (AUDIT BEFORE FIXING) ===

python PythonHelpers/generate_error_summary.py spanish 3a

This generates SpanishWords/SpanishErrorsSummary3A.csv with pre-scanned errors.

Open TranslationErrorReport.html in your browser to review:
- Total issues per pack
- Pinyin spacing errors
- Bracket errors (failed translations)
- Empty cells

This gives you a clear view of ALL errors before starting the fix process.
The error summary will guide your manual review and fix table creation.

=== STEP 1: CLEAR ALL EXISTING SCORES (FRESH START) ===
python PythonHelpers/clear_translation_scores.py spanish

This clears ALL scores in SpanishWordsTranslationErrors.csv, ensuring a fresh evaluation.
You will fill in every Score and Issues cell from scratch.

=== STEP 0A: TRIM SPACES (ALWAYS RUN FIRST!) ===

python PythonHelpers/trim_csv_spaces.py spanish
   → Removes leading/trailing spaces from ALL cells
   → Turns "some text   " into "some text"
   → Run this BEFORE all other validation!

=== STEP 0B: PYTHON VALIDATION (6 SCRIPTS - MECHANICAL ERROR DETECTION) ===

Run ALL 6 validation scripts to catch mechanical errors:

1. python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py spanish
   → Character-by-character pinyin mapping
   → Prevents "?" appearing in DecoderTest.html
   → Catches: nǐhǎo (wrong) vs nǐ hǎo (correct)
   → Catches: hǎo ， (wrong) vs hǎo， (correct - punctuation attached)
   → Catches: ATM jī (wrong) vs A T M jī (correct - letter-by-letter)

2. python PythonHelpers/check_translation_quality.py spanish
   → Brackets [  ] in cells (failed auto-translation)
   → Empty translation cells

3. python PythonHelpers/check_language_mismatch.py spanish
   → Spanish text in Chinese column
   → Chinese characters in Spanish column
   → Wrong Unicode script in wrong column

4. python PythonHelpers/check_latin_in_chinese.py spanish
   → Illegitimate Latin in Chinese column
   → Catches: "la", "los", "el" (Spanish articles - NOT loanwords)
   → Allows: "ATM", "DNA", "WiFi" (legitimate Chinese loanwords)

5. python PythonHelpers/check_punctuation.py spanish
   → Flags ALL symbols/punctuation in ALL columns for manual review
   → ERROR: |, [, ], {}, <> (likely translation failures)
   → WARNING: ?, !, . (needs review)
   → INFO: All other punctuation (commas, quotes, accents, etc.)
   → Chinese comma placement - MUST match pinyin character-by-character
   → Catches: Chinese "是的，先生" but pinyin "shì de xiān shēng" (missing comma)

6. python PythonHelpers/verify_words_integrity.py spanish
   → Overview ↔ Breakout CSV sync
   → Row count mismatches
   → Accidentally added/deleted rows

⚠️ Python scripts flag mechanical errors. Note all flagged packs.
⚠️ BUT: Zero Python errors ≠ Zero issues! Manual review still required!


⚠️⚠️⚠️ SPANISH ARTICLES: SIMPLE TRANSLATION ONLY ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Spanish articles (el, la, los, las) → Just translate to "the"!

DO NOT use grammar terminology:
❌ el → 定冠词 (definite article) - THIS IS WRONG!
❌ el → 阳性定冠词 (masculine article) - THIS IS WRONG!
❌ the → the (masculine) - THIS IS WRONG!

CORRECT translation:
✅ el → the (English)
✅ el → 这/这个 (Chinese - "this" or context-appropriate)
✅ la → the (English)
✅ los → the (English - plural but still "the")
✅ las → the (English - plural but still "the")

These are VOCABULARY cards, not grammar lessons!
Users need SIMPLE, NATURAL translations to learn!

║  📖 STRAIGHTFORWARD TRANSLATION RULES - NO GRAMMAR LESSONS!      ║
║                                                                  ║
║  These are VOCABULARY CARDS, not grammar textbooks!             ║
║  Use SIMPLE, NATURAL, HELPFUL translations.                     ║

║  ❌ WRONG APPROACH (Too formal, confusing):                      ║
║  • "the" → "the (masculine)" ❌ Over-clarification               ║
║  • "el" → "定冠词" (grammar term) ❌ This is NOT a translation!  ║

║  ✅ CORRECT APPROACH (Simple, straightforward):                  ║
║  • "the" → "the" ✅ No gender labels needed                      ║
║  • "el" → "the" ✅ Just translate it!                            ║
║  • "la" → "the" ✅ Same word in English                          ║
║  • "los" → "the" ✅ Plural = still "the"                         ║

║  🔑 GOLDEN RULES:                                                ║
║                                                                  ║
║  1. Use MOST COMMON everyday translation                        ║
║     NOT: "canine" ✅ YES: "dog"                                  ║
║     NOT: "definite article" ✅ YES: "the"                        ║

║  2. NO grammar terminology in translations                      ║
║     ❌ "定冠词" (definite article)                               ║
║     ❌ "阳性冠词" (masculine article)                            ║
║     ✅ Just translate to natural equivalent                     ║
║                                                                  ║
║  3. NO clarifying labels in parentheses                         ║
║     ❌ "the (masculine)"                                         ║
║     ❌ "friend (male)"                                           ║
║     ✅ Just "the", just "friend"                                 ║
║                                                                  ║
║  4. If word has multiple meanings, use MOST COMMON              ║
║     Example: "set" → "set" (not "collection" or "group")        ║
║     Context from Pack_Title determines which meaning            ║
║                                                                  ║
║  5. Chinese for Spanish articles:                               ║
║     • el, la, los, las → Chinese equivalent of "the"            ║
║     • NOT grammar terms!                                         ║
║     • Think: "What would Chinese speaker naturally say?"        ║
║     • Answer: 这个/那个 (this/that) or omit (Chinese often      ║
║       doesn't need articles)                                     ║
║                                                                  ║
║  6. Keep it NATURAL and HELPFUL                                 ║
║     Ask: "Would this help someone learn, or confuse them?"      ║
║     Grammar lessons = confusing ❌                               ║
║     Simple translation = helpful ✅                              ║
║                                                                  ║
║  ⚠️  Remember: Users are learning VOCABULARY, not grammar!      ║
║  ⚠️  Formal/technical translations make learning HARDER!        ║

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Spanish Packs: SpanishWords1.csv through SpanishWords250.csv
Location: SpanishWords/SpanishWords{N}.csv

FOR EACH PACK, use Read tool: Read("SpanishWords/SpanishWords{N}.csv")

Then check EVERY ROW, EVERY COLUMN:
   - Column 0 (spanish): SACRED - Skip this. It's correct from Combined_Words.
   - Column 1 (english): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?
   - Column 2 (chinese): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Simplified only?
   - Column 3 (pinyin): Character-by-character mapping? Correct tones? Punctuation attached correctly?
   - Column 4 (portuguese): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?

⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE CRITICAL ISSUE: WRONG MEANINGS FROM AUTO-TRANSLATION ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Column 0 (spanish) is CORRECT - it came from Combined_Words validated in Stages 1-2.
The problem is: TRANSLATIONS (columns 1-4) may have the WRONG MEANING because
many words have multiple meanings depending on context!

EXAMPLE:
Pack: "Musical Instruments"
Column 0: "bajo" ← CORRECT word for theme (bass guitar, from Combined_Words)
Column 1 (english): "short" or "under" ← WRONG! Wrong meaning of "bajo"
Column 1 SHOULD BE: "bass" ← CORRECT! (the musical instrument)

ANOTHER EXAMPLE:
Pack: "Kitchen Utensils"
Column 0: "copa" ← CORRECT word for theme (wine glass, from Combined_Words)
Column 1 (english): "trophy" ← WRONG! (copa = trophy in sports context)
Column 1 SHOULD BE: "wine glass" ← CORRECT! (drinking vessel)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER PINYIN MAPPING - CRITICAL! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

MAPPING RULE:
Each Chinese character (with trailing punctuation) → one pinyin syllable (with same punctuation)

✅ CORRECT EXAMPLE:
Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo， xiān shēng

Character-by-character breakdown:
早   → zǎo
上   → shàng
好， → hǎo，   (punctuation attached!)
先   → xiān
生   → shēng

❌ WRONG EXAMPLES:
Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo, xiān shēng  ❌ (Latin comma instead of Chinese comma)

Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo ， xiān shēng  ❌ (space before comma)

Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎoshànghǎo， xiān shēng  ❌ (missing spaces between syllables)

WHY: Pinyin displays directly under Chinese characters in the game.
Each character must map to exactly one syllable with matching punctuation.

RULE: Punctuation sticks to character → punctuation sticks to syllable
`好，` → `hǎo，` (not `hǎo ，` or `hǎo,`)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ LATIN TEXT IN CHINESE COLUMN - CRITICAL EVALUATION! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

NOT ALL Latin text in Chinese columns is acceptable! You must distinguish between:

✅ LEGITIMATE LOANWORDS (Used in actual Chinese):
   - Technology: DNA, ATM, GPS, NFT, USB, CD, DVD, WiFi, 5G, AI, VR
   - Brands/Apps: WhatsApp, iPhone, iPad, Uber, Tesla
   - Fashion: T恤 (T-shirt), T台 (runway), X光 (X-ray)
   - Common: OK, bye, email, app, web

   Examples:
   Chinese: ATM机      Pinyin: ATM jī       ✅ CORRECT (ATM is used in Chinese)
   Chinese: DNA测试     Pinyin: DNA cè shì   ✅ CORRECT (DNA is used in Chinese)
   Chinese: T恤        Pinyin: T xù         ✅ CORRECT (T is used in Chinese for T-shirt)
   Chinese: NFT        Pinyin: NFT          ✅ CORRECT (NFT is used in Chinese)

❌ TRANSLATION FAILURES (Must be fixed):
   - Spanish articles: la, los, el, las, un, una
   - Untranslated Spanish words that aren't Chinese loanwords
   - Any Latin text NOT in the legitimate loanword list

   Examples:
   Chinese: la         Pinyin: la           ❌ WRONG! (Spanish article, not Chinese)
   Chinese: los        Pinyin: los          ❌ WRONG! (Spanish article, not Chinese)
   Chinese: el         Pinyin: el           ❌ WRONG! (Spanish article, not Chinese)

HOW TO CHECK:
1. See Latin text in Chinese column? Ask: "Do Chinese speakers actually use this term?"
2. If it's a Spanish article (la, los, el, las, un, una) → ❌ TRANSLATION FAILURE
3. If it's NOT in the loanword list above → ❌ LIKELY TRANSLATION FAILURE
4. If unsure → Run: python PythonHelpers/check_latin_in_chinese.py spanish

⚠️⚠️⚠️ LATIN LETTERS IN CHINESE - CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

When Chinese contains Latin letters, each Latin LETTER maps to itself:

RULE: Latin letters map LETTER-BY-LETTER (A→A, T→T, M→M)

✅ CORRECT MAPPING:
Chinese: ATM机
Mapping: A → A,  T → T,  M → M,  机 → jī
Pinyin:  A T M jī            (each letter separate with spaces!)

Chinese: T恤
Mapping: T → T,  恤 → xù
Pinyin:  T xù                (letter T maps to itself)

Chinese: 在WhatsApp上
Mapping: 在→zài,  W→W, h→h, a→a, t→t, s→s, A→A, p→p, p→p,  上→shàng
Pinyin:  zài W h a t s A p p shàng   (each letter separate!)

❌ WRONG MAPPING:
Chinese: ATM机
Pinyin:  ATM jī              ❌ (ATM should be "A T M" - letter-by-letter!)

Chinese: 在WhatsApp上
Pinyin:  zài WhatsApp shàng  ❌ (WhatsApp should be "W h a t s A p p")

WHY: The game renders each character/letter in a separate block.
Latin letters must have spaces between them just like Chinese syllables.

QUALITY CHECK FOR EACH TRANSLATION:
□ Does the translation match the CORRECT MEANING for this pack's theme?
□ Did auto-translation pick the RIGHT definition of this word?
□ Is this the most COMMON way to say this? (not rare/formal)
□ Would a NATIVE SPEAKER actually use this phrase?
□ Is the grammar CORRECT?
□ Are special characters/accents CORRECT? (á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ, ü)
□ Character-by-character pinyin mapping with punctuation attached? (好，→ hǎo，)

SCORING SCALE:
  10 = Perfect (no issues at all - every translation is excellent)
  9  = Excellent (trivial issues only, acceptable as-is)
  8  = Good (minor issues that should be fixed)
  7  = Fair (several issues across translations)
  6 or below = Poor (significant issues, definitely needs work)

=== STEP 4: UPDATE THE TRANSLATION ERRORS CSV ===

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  📝 EDIT TWO FILES FOR EACH PACK:                                ║
║  1. SpanishWords/SpanishWordsTranslationErrors.csv               ║
║  2. SpanishWords/SpanishFixTable.csv                             ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

=== FILE 1: TranslationErrors.csv ===
The CSV has these columns:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pack_Number | Pack number (1-250) - DO NOT EDIT |
| Pack_Title | Title of the pack - DO NOT EDIT |
| Difficulty_Act | Act assignment - DO NOT EDIT |
| Issue_Count | NUMBER of issues found - FILL THIS IN |
| Issues | BRIEF SUMMARY of issues - FILL THIS IN |

=== FILE 2: SpanishFixTable.csv ===
For EACH issue you find, add a row to the fix table:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Language | "spanish" (pre-filled by init script) |
| Pack_Number | Pack number (pre-filled by init script) |
| Row_Number | Row number in breakout CSV (YOU FILL) |
| Column_Name | Column to fix (YOU FILL) |
| Old_Value | Current incorrect value (YOU FILL) |
| New_Value | Correct value (YOU FILL) |
| Reason | Why this fix is needed (YOU FILL) |

FOR EACH PACK (1-250):
1. Read the breakout CSV: SpanishWords/SpanishWords{N}.csv
2. Evaluate all translations carefully - BE EXTREMELY NITPICKY

⛔ EVERY PACK MUST HAVE Issue_Count filled in! ⛔

=== STEP 5: APPLY FIXES (MANDATORY - NOT OPTIONAL!) ===

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE FIX TABLE IS USELESS WITHOUT RUNNING APPLY! ⚠️⚠️⚠️  ║
║                                                                  ║
║  The fix table is ONLY an intermediate artifact.                ║
║  TASK IS A TOTAL FAIL if you don't actually apply the fixes!    ║

║  IMMEDIATELY after completing the fix table:                    ║
║  1. Run: python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py SpanishWords/SpanishFixTable.csv
║  2. If errors occur → debug and rerun until SUCCESS             ║
║  3. Final output = FIXED DATASET (actual CSV files changed)     ║

║  DO NOT ask for review. DO NOT stop at the fix table.           ║
║  The job is NOT done until the CSVs are actually fixed!         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

APPLY WORKFLOW:
1. Run: python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py SpanishWords/SpanishFixTable.csv
2. Check output for mismatches or errors
3. If errors:
   - Debug: Are Row_Numbers correct? (Header = row 1, data starts row 2)
   - Debug: Do Old_Values match exactly what's in the CSV?
   - Fix the fix table and rerun
4. When apply succeeds with 0 mismatches → Validate and commit
5. Run validation: python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py spanish
6. Commit and PR to main

SURGICAL EDIT PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL!):
- Edits target specific: Language, Pack_Number, Row_Number, Column_Name
- NEVER blanket "replace A with B in all CSVs"
- Each fix must specify exact location: which pack, which row, which column

=== STEP 0: GENERATE ERROR SUMMARY (AUDIT BEFORE FIXING) ===

python PythonHelpers/generate_error_summary.py spanish 3b

This generates SpanishWords/SpanishErrorsSummary3B.csv with pre-scanned errors.

Open TranslationErrorReport.html in your browser to review:
- Total issues per pack
- Pinyin spacing errors
- Bracket errors (failed translations)
- Empty cells

This gives you a clear view of ALL errors before starting the fix process.
The error summary will guide your fix table creation.

=== STEP 1: READ TRANSLATION ERRORS CSV ===

Use Read tool: SpanishWords/SpanishWordsTranslationErrors.csv

This shows:
- Issue_Count: Number of problems in each pack
- Issues: Brief summary of what's wrong

Focus on packs where Issue_Count > 0.

=== STEP 2: SCAN PACKS AND RECORD FIXES ===

For EACH pack with issues:

1. Read pack CSV: SpanishWords/SpanishWords{N}.csv
2. Identify EVERY problem (pinyin errors, translation errors, empty cells, theme mismatches)
3. Record fix in SpanishWords/SpanishFixTableB.csv with MINIMAL data:

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  📝 SpanishFixTableB.csv FORMAT (NO Reason column!)              ║

║  That's it! Just 6 columns. Pack_Title provides critical theme context! No explanations needed.             ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

⚡ WRITE ONLY:
- Language (pre-filled: "spanish")
- Pack_Number (e.g., "23")
- Row_Number (CSV row number - remember row 1 is header, data starts at row 2)
- Column_Name (e.g., "english", "chinese", "pinyin", "portuguese")
- Old_Value (current wrong value - can be empty string if cell is empty)
- New_Value (what it should be)

❌ DO NOT WRITE:
- Reason/explanation (no such column!)
- Comments about why it's wrong
- Multiple values in one cell

=== CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES ===

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔒 NEVER change Column 1 | spanish column is SACRED - only fix translations (columns 2-5) |
| ⚠️ Pinyin mapping | Character-by-character with punctuation attached: 好，→ hǎo， |
| ⚠️ Latin letters | Letter-by-letter mapping: ATM机 → A T M jī |
| ⚠️ Theme matching | Check if TRANSLATION matches intended meaning for pack theme |
| ⚠️ Empty cells | Record as empty Old_Value, provide New_Value |

║  The job is NOT done until the CSVs are actually fixed!         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

APPLY WORKFLOW:
1. Run: python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py SpanishWords/SpanishFixTableB.csv
2. Check output for mismatches or errors
3. If errors:
   - Debug: Are Row_Numbers correct? (Header = row 1, data starts row 2)
   - Debug: Do Old_Values match exactly what's in the CSV?
   - Fix the fix table and rerun
4. When apply succeeds with 0 mismatches → Validate and commit
5. Run validation: python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py spanish
6. All good? Proceed to Step 4

SURGICAL EDIT PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL!):
- Edits target specific: Language, Pack_Number, Row_Number, Column_Name
- NEVER blanket "replace A with B in all CSVs"
- Each fix must specify exact location: which pack, which row, which column
- Can fix 500 rows at once, but EACH must be surgically specified
- Even if the same error is in ALL rows of ALL packs, specify each one!

=== STEP 5: COMMIT AND PUSH ===

git add .
git commit -m "Stage 3B: Apply surgical fixes to Spanish packs"
git push -u origin <branch-name>

=== EXAMPLE WORKFLOW ===

1. Read SpanishWordsTranslationErrors.csv → See Pack 23 has issues
2. Read SpanishWords/SpanishWords23.csv → Find 3 problems:
   - Row 3, pinyin: "nǐhǎo" (missing space)
   - Row 7, english: "hello friend boy" (awkward)
   - Row 12, portuguese: "" (empty cell)

3. Record in SpanishFixTableB.csv:
   ```
   spanish,23,3,pinyin,nǐhǎo,nǐ hǎo
   spanish,23,7,english,hello friend boy,hey buddy
   spanish,23,12,portuguese,,olá amigo
   ```

4. Move to next pack, repeat

5. After ALL packs scanned, run:
   python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py SpanishWords/SpanishFixTableB.csv

║     - Right meaning for this theme?                              ║
║     - Natural phrasing for native speaker?                       ║

=== STEP 0: GENERATE ERROR SUMMARY (AUDIT BEFORE FIXING) ===

python PythonHelpers/generate_error_summary.py english 3a

This generates EnglishWords/EnglishErrorsSummary3A.csv with pre-scanned errors.

Open TranslationErrorReport.html in your browser to review:
- Total issues per pack
- Pinyin spacing errors
- Bracket errors (failed translations)
- Empty cells

This gives you a clear view of ALL errors before starting the fix process.
The error summary will guide your manual review and fix table creation.

=== STEP 1: CLEAR ALL EXISTING SCORES (FRESH START) ===
python PythonHelpers/clear_translation_scores.py english

This clears ALL scores in EnglishWordsTranslationErrors.csv, ensuring a fresh evaluation.
You will fill in every Score and Issues cell from scratch.

=== STEP 0A: TRIM SPACES (ALWAYS RUN FIRST!) ===

python PythonHelpers/trim_csv_spaces.py english
   → Removes leading/trailing spaces from ALL cells
   → Turns "some text   " into "some text"
   → Run this BEFORE all other validation!

=== STEP 0B: PYTHON VALIDATION (6 SCRIPTS - MECHANICAL ERROR DETECTION) ===

Run ALL 6 validation scripts to catch mechanical errors:

1. python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py english
   → Character-by-character pinyin mapping
   → Prevents "?" appearing in DecoderTest.html
   → Catches: nǐhǎo (wrong) vs nǐ hǎo (correct)
   → Catches: hǎo ， (wrong) vs hǎo， (correct - punctuation attached)
   → Catches: ATM jī (wrong) vs A T M jī (correct - letter-by-letter)

2. python PythonHelpers/check_translation_quality.py english
   → Brackets [  ] in cells (failed auto-translation)
   → Empty translation cells

3. python PythonHelpers/check_language_mismatch.py english
   → Spanish text in Chinese column
   → Chinese characters in Spanish column
   → Wrong Unicode script in wrong column

4. python PythonHelpers/check_latin_in_chinese.py english
   → Illegitimate Latin in Chinese column
   → Catches: "la", "los", "el" (Spanish articles - NOT loanwords)
   → Allows: "ATM", "DNA", "WiFi" (legitimate Chinese loanwords)

5. python PythonHelpers/check_punctuation.py english
   → Flags ALL symbols/punctuation in ALL columns for manual review
   → ERROR: |, [, ], {}, <> (likely translation failures)
   → WARNING: ?, !, . (needs review)
   → INFO: All other punctuation (commas, quotes, accents, etc.)
   → Chinese comma placement - MUST match pinyin character-by-character
   → Catches: Chinese "是的，先生" but pinyin "shì de xiān shēng" (missing comma)

6. python PythonHelpers/verify_words_integrity.py english
   → Overview ↔ Breakout CSV sync
   → Row count mismatches
   → Accidentally added/deleted rows

⚠️ Python scripts flag mechanical errors. Note all flagged packs.
⚠️ BUT: Zero Python errors ≠ Zero issues! Manual review still required!


⚠️⚠️⚠️ SPANISH ARTICLES: SIMPLE TRANSLATION ONLY ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Spanish articles (el, la, los, las) → Just translate to "the"!

DO NOT use grammar terminology:
❌ el → 定冠词 (definite article) - THIS IS WRONG!
❌ el → 阳性定冠词 (masculine article) - THIS IS WRONG!
❌ the → the (masculine) - THIS IS WRONG!

CORRECT translation:
✅ el → the (English)
✅ el → 这/这个 (Chinese - "this" or context-appropriate)
✅ la → the (English)
✅ los → the (English - plural but still "the")
✅ las → the (English - plural but still "the")

These are VOCABULARY cards, not grammar lessons!
Users need SIMPLE, NATURAL translations to learn!

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

English Packs: EnglishWords1.csv through EnglishWords160.csv
Location: EnglishWords/EnglishWords{N}.csv

FOR EACH PACK, use Read tool: Read("EnglishWords/EnglishWords{N}.csv")

Then check EVERY ROW, EVERY COLUMN:
   - Column 0 (english): SACRED - Skip this. It's the correct word for the theme (from Combined_Words).
   - Column 1 (chinese): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Simplified only?
   - Column 2 (pinyin): Character-by-character mapping? Correct tones? Punctuation attached correctly?
   - Column 3 (spanish): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?
   - Column 4 (portuguese): Does it match the INTENDED MEANING for this theme? Natural?

⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE CRITICAL ISSUE: WRONG MEANINGS FROM AUTO-TRANSLATION ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Column 0 (english) is CORRECT for the pack theme. The problem is:
TRANSLATIONS (columns 1-4) may have the WRONG MEANING because many words have
multiple meanings depending on context!

EXAMPLE:
Pack: "Sports Equipment"
Column 0: "bat" ← CORRECT word for theme (baseball bat)
Column 1 (chinese): "蝙蝠" ← WRONG! (flying animal bat)
Column 1 SHOULD BE: "球棒" ← CORRECT! (baseball bat)

ANOTHER EXAMPLE:
Pack: "Animals"
Column 0: "bat" ← CORRECT word for theme (flying mammal)
Column 1 (chinese): "球棒" ← WRONG! (sports equipment)
Column 1 SHOULD BE: "蝙蝠" ← CORRECT! (the animal)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER PINYIN MAPPING - CRITICAL! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

MAPPING RULE:
Each Chinese character (with trailing punctuation) → one pinyin syllable (with same punctuation)

✅ CORRECT EXAMPLE:
Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo， xiān shēng

Character-by-character breakdown:
早   → zǎo
上   → shàng
好， → hǎo，   (punctuation attached!)
先   → xiān
生   → shēng

❌ WRONG EXAMPLES:
Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo, xiān shēng  ❌ (Latin comma instead of Chinese comma)

Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎo shàng hǎo ， xiān shēng  ❌ (space before comma)

Chinese: 早上好，先生
Pinyin:  zǎoshànghǎo， xiān shēng  ❌ (missing spaces between syllables)

WHY: Pinyin displays directly under Chinese characters in the game.
Each character must map to exactly one syllable with matching punctuation.

RULE: Punctuation sticks to character → punctuation sticks to syllable
`好，` → `hǎo，` (not `hǎo ，` or `hǎo,`)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ LATIN TEXT IN CHINESE COLUMN - CRITICAL EVALUATION! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

NOT ALL Latin text in Chinese columns is acceptable! You must distinguish between:

✅ LEGITIMATE LOANWORDS (Used in actual Chinese):
   - Technology: DNA, ATM, GPS, NFT, USB, CD, DVD, WiFi, 5G, AI, VR
   - Brands/Apps: WhatsApp, iPhone, iPad, Uber, Tesla
   - Fashion: T恤 (T-shirt), T台 (runway), X光 (X-ray)
   - Common: OK, bye, email, app, web

   Examples:
   Chinese: ATM机      Pinyin: ATM jī       ✅ CORRECT (ATM is used in Chinese)
   Chinese: DNA测试     Pinyin: DNA cè shì   ✅ CORRECT (DNA is used in Chinese)
   Chinese: X光        Pinyin: X guāng      ✅ CORRECT (X is used in Chinese for X-ray)
   Chinese: NFT        Pinyin: NFT          ✅ CORRECT (NFT is used in Chinese)

❌ TRANSLATION FAILURES (Must be fixed):
   - Untranslated English words that aren't Chinese loanwords
   - Random English words copied into Chinese column
   - Any Latin text NOT in the legitimate loanword list

HOW TO CHECK:
1. See Latin text in Chinese column? Ask: "Do Chinese speakers actually use this term?"
2. If it's NOT in the loanword list above → ❌ LIKELY TRANSLATION FAILURE
3. If unsure → Run: python PythonHelpers/check_latin_in_chinese.py english

⚠️⚠️⚠️ LATIN LETTERS IN CHINESE - CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

When Chinese contains Latin letters, each Latin LETTER maps to itself:

RULE: Latin letters map LETTER-BY-LETTER (A→A, T→T, M→M)

✅ CORRECT MAPPING:
Chinese: ATM机
Mapping: A → A,  T → T,  M → M,  机 → jī
Pinyin:  A T M jī            (each letter separate with spaces!)

Chinese: T恤
Mapping: T → T,  恤 → xù
Pinyin:  T xù                (letter T maps to itself)

Chinese: 在WhatsApp上
Mapping: 在→zài,  W→W, h→h, a→a, t→t, s→s, A→A, p→p, p→p,  上→shàng
Pinyin:  zài W h a t s A p p shàng   (each letter separate!)

❌ WRONG MAPPING:
Chinese: ATM机
Pinyin:  ATM jī              ❌ (ATM should be "A T M" - letter-by-letter!)

Chinese: 在WhatsApp上
Pinyin:  zài WhatsApp shàng  ❌ (WhatsApp should be "W h a t s A p p")

WHY: The game renders each character/letter in a separate block.
Latin letters must have spaces between them just like Chinese syllables.

QUALITY CHECK FOR EACH TRANSLATION:
□ Does the translation match the CORRECT MEANING for this pack's theme?
□ Did auto-translation pick the RIGHT definition of this word?
□ Is this the most COMMON way to say this? (not rare/formal)
□ Would a NATIVE SPEAKER actually use this phrase?
□ Is the grammar CORRECT?
□ Are special characters/accents CORRECT?
□ Character-by-character pinyin mapping with punctuation attached? (好，→ hǎo，)

SCORING SCALE:
  10 = Perfect (no issues at all - every translation is excellent)
  9  = Excellent (trivial issues only, acceptable as-is)
  8  = Good (minor issues that should be fixed)
  7  = Fair (several issues across translations)
  6 or below = Poor (significant issues, definitely needs work)

=== STEP 4: UPDATE THE TRANSLATION ERRORS CSV ===

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  📝 EDIT TWO FILES FOR EACH PACK:                                ║

| Difficulty_Act | Act assignment - DO NOT EDIT |
| Issue_Count | NUMBER of issues found - FILL THIS IN |
| Issues | BRIEF SUMMARY of issues - FILL THIS IN |

=== FILE 2: EnglishFixTable.csv ===
For EACH issue you find, add a row to the fix table:
| Column | Description |

| Column_Name | Column to fix (YOU FILL) |
| Old_Value | Current incorrect value (YOU FILL) |
| New_Value | Correct value (YOU FILL) |
| Reason | Why this fix is needed (YOU FILL) |

FOR EACH PACK (1-160):
1. Read the breakout CSV: EnglishWords/EnglishWords{N}.csv
2. Evaluate all translations carefully - BE EXTREMELY NITPICKY

║  The job is NOT done until the CSVs are actually fixed!         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

APPLY WORKFLOW:
1. Run: python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py EnglishWords/EnglishFixTable.csv
2. Check output for mismatches or errors
3. If errors:
   - Debug: Are Row_Numbers correct? (Header = row 1, data starts row 2)
   - Debug: Do Old_Values match exactly what's in the CSV?
   - Fix the fix table and rerun
4. When apply succeeds with 0 mismatches → Validate and commit
5. Run validation: python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py english
6. Commit and PR to main

SURGICAL EDIT PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL!):
- Edits target specific: Language, Pack_Number, Row_Number, Column_Name
- NEVER blanket "replace A with B in all CSVs"
- Each fix must specify exact location: which pack, which row, which column
- Can fix 500 rows at once, but EACH must be surgically specified
- Even if the same error is in ALL rows of ALL packs, specify each one!

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

=== STEP 0: GENERATE ERROR SUMMARY (AUDIT BEFORE FIXING) ===

python PythonHelpers/generate_error_summary.py english 3b

This generates EnglishWords/EnglishErrorsSummary3B.csv with pre-scanned errors.

Open TranslationErrorReport.html in your browser to review:
- Total issues per pack
- Pinyin spacing errors
- Bracket errors (failed translations)
- Empty cells

This gives you a clear view of ALL errors before starting the fix process.
The error summary will guide your fix table creation.

=== STEP 1: READ TRANSLATION ERRORS CSV ===

Use Read tool: EnglishWords/EnglishWordsTranslationErrors.csv

This shows:
- Issue_Count: Number of problems in each pack
- Issues: Brief summary of what's wrong

Focus on packs where Issue_Count > 0.

=== STEP 2: SCAN PACKS AND RECORD FIXES ===

For EACH pack with issues:

1. Read pack CSV: EnglishWords/EnglishWords{N}.csv
2. Identify EVERY problem (pinyin errors, translation errors, empty cells, theme mismatches)
3. Record fix in EnglishWords/EnglishFixTableB.csv with MINIMAL data:

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

⚡ WRITE ONLY:
- Language (pre-filled: "english")
- Pack_Number (e.g., "23")
- Row_Number (CSV row number - remember row 1 is header, data starts at row 2)
- Column_Name (e.g., "chinese", "pinyin", "spanish", "portuguese")
- Old_Value (current wrong value - can be empty string if cell is empty)
- New_Value (what it should be)

❌ DO NOT WRITE:
- Reason/explanation (no such column!)
- Comments about why it's wrong
- Multiple values in one cell

=== CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES ===

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔒 NEVER change Column 0 | english column is SACRED - only fix translations (columns 1-4) |
| ⚠️ Pinyin mapping | Character-by-character with punctuation attached: 好，→ hǎo， |
| ⚠️ Latin letters | Letter-by-letter mapping: ATM机 → A T M jī |
| ⚠️ Theme matching | Check if TRANSLATION matches intended meaning for pack theme |
| ⚠️ Empty cells | Record as empty Old_Value, provide New_Value |

=== PINYIN COMMA CONVENTION (CRITICAL!) ===

║  DO NOT ask for review. DO NOT stop at the fix table.           ║
║  The job is NOT done until the CSVs are actually fixed!         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

APPLY WORKFLOW:
1. Run: python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py EnglishWords/EnglishFixTableB.csv
2. Check output for mismatches or errors
3. If errors:
   - Debug: Are Row_Numbers correct? (Header = row 1, data starts row 2)
   - Debug: Do Old_Values match exactly what's in the CSV?
   - Fix the fix table and rerun
4. When apply succeeds with 0 mismatches → Validate and commit
5. Run validation: python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py english
6. All good? Proceed to Step 4

SURGICAL EDIT PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL!):
- Edits target specific: Language, Pack_Number, Row_Number, Column_Name
- NEVER blanket "replace A with B in all CSVs"
- Each fix must specify exact location: which pack, which row, which column
- Can fix 500 rows at once, but EACH must be surgically specified
- Even if the same error is in ALL rows of ALL packs, specify each one!

=== STEP 5: COMMIT AND PUSH ===

git add .
git commit -m "Stage 3B: Apply surgical fixes to English packs"
git push -u origin <branch-name>

=== EXAMPLE WORKFLOW ===

1. Read EnglishWordsTranslationErrors.csv → See Pack 23 has issues
2. Read EnglishWords/EnglishWords23.csv → Find 3 problems:
   - Row 3, pinyin: "nǐhǎo" (missing space)
   - Row 7, spanish: "hola tu" (missing accent)
   - Row 12, chinese: "" (empty cell)

3. Record in EnglishFixTableB.csv:
   ```
   english,23,3,pinyin,nǐhǎo,nǐ hǎo
   english,23,7,spanish,hola tu,hola tú
   english,23,12,chinese,,你好
   ```

4. Move to next pack, repeat

5. After ALL packs scanned, run:
   python PythonHelpers/apply_fixes.py EnglishWords/EnglishFixTableB.csv

=== BREAKOUT CSV COLUMNS (5 columns) ===

| Col | Name       | Editable? | Notes                        |
|-----|------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| 0   | english    | 🔒 NEVER  | Sacred - matches Overview    |
| 1   | chinese    | ✅ YES    | Translation                  |
| 2   | pinyin     | ✅ YES    | Char-by-char mapping (punctuation attached) |

| 4   | portuguese | ✅ YES    | Translation                  |

=== SUCCESS CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED!) ===

✅ EnglishFixTableB.csv has entries for EVERY issue found
✅ ⚠️ apply_fixes.py runs successfully with 0 mismatches (MANDATORY!)
✅ ⚠️ Actual CSV files are CHANGED (fix table alone = FAIL!)
✅ Validation passes (validate_pinyin.py english)

<h3>All Languages - Stage 4 (Single Prompt)</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Generate JavaScript modules from ALL breakout CSVs (Chinese, Spanish, English)

=== THIS IS SIMPLE - JUST RUN THE SCRIPTS ===
Stage 4 is straightforward: run Python scripts to convert CSVs to JS modules.
No manual editing needed. Scripts do all the work.

=== STEP 1: RUN ALL THREE CONVERSION SCRIPTS ===
python ChineseWords/ChineseWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py
python SpanishWords/SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py
python EnglishWords/EnglishWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py

Each script:
- Reads breakout CSVs ([Lang]Words1.csv, [Lang]Words2.csv, ...)
- Groups packs into acts based on Overview CSV
- Outputs CLEAN JS: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules/act{N}-{name}.js
- Outputs OBFUSCATED JS: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules-js/act{N}-{name}-js.js

=== STEP 2: UPDATE LINK.txt ===
python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

This updates LINK.txt with all the new JS module URLs.

=== STEP 3: VERIFY (OPTIONAL) ===
Open DecoderTest.html in browser to confirm modules decode correctly.

=== STEP 4: COMMIT AND PR ===
git add .
git commit -m "Regenerate JS modules for all languages"
git push

=== WHAT THE SCRIPTS PRODUCE ===

CHINESE (107 packs → 5 acts, 6 columns):
- Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js ... act5-refinement.js
- Columns: chinese, pinyin, english, spanish, french, portuguese

SPANISH (250 packs → 7 acts, 5 columns):

<h3>Fresh LLM Rating Prompt</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Rate the quality of wordpack data (UNBIASED REVIEW)

=== IMPORTANT ===
You are rating work done by another LLM agent. You have NOT seen this data before.
Provide an honest, unbiased assessment. Do not assume the work is good.

=== WHAT TO RATE ===
Rate each aspect 1-10 and provide an OVERALL score.

For BASE WORDS (Stage 1):
- Theme fit: Do words match the pack's stated theme?
- Usefulness: Are these words learners should know?
- Completeness: Are obvious words missing?
- No phrases: Are all entries vocabulary items (not sentences)?
- No duplicates: Each word appears in only one pack?

For EXAMPLE WORDS (Stage 2):
- Contains base word: Does each example contain its base word?
- Natural usage: Are examples phrases people actually say?
- Variety: Are the 2 examples per word different enough?
- Correct count: Exactly 2 examples per base word?

For TRANSLATIONS (Stage 3):
- Accuracy: Are translations correct?
- Pinyin format: Character-by-character mapping, punctuation attached?
- Simplified Chinese: No Traditional characters?
- Consistency: Same quality across all rows?

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Theme Fit: X/10 - [brief comment]
Usefulness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Completeness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Format Correctness: X/10 - [brief comment]
...

OVERALL SCORE: X/10

SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND:
1. [Issue and how to fix]
2. [Issue and how to fix]
...

VERDICT: [PASS if >= 9.0] or [NEEDS IMPROVEMENT if < 9.0]

=== BE HONEST ===
If the work is excellent, say so. If it has problems, list them clearly.
The goal is quality, not politeness.</div>
