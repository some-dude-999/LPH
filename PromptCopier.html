WORDPACK CONSTRUCTION PIPELINE - DOCUMENTATION FOR LLMs AND HUMANS
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEM:
-----------------------
This is a multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality
language learning flashcard data. The goal is to create vocabulary wordpacks
for a flashcard game that teaches Chinese, Spanish, and English.

THE ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP:
---------------------------
Each stage follows the same iterative pattern:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                                 │
    │   1. LLM Agent reviews current state                           │
    │   2. LLM scores quality (1-10) and lists improvements          │
    │   3. LLM makes changes                                         │
    │   4. Python scripts validate (duplicates, format, etc.)        │
    │   5. LLM fixes any Python-detected issues                      │
    │   6. LLM scores again                                          │
    │   7. If score < 9, feed to NEW LLM instance (unbiased)         │
    │   8. New LLM rates, suggests improvements                      │
    │   9. Repeat until score >= 9.0 or 9.5                          │
    │                                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WHY USE PYTHON FOR VALIDATION?
------------------------------
Python scripts are used for simple logic checks because:
- Code is faster than LLM for counting, string matching, duplicate detection
- LLMs have limited attention and consume tokens on repetitive checks
- Python catches 100% of format errors; LLMs might miss some
- Frees LLM to focus on creative/semantic work (quality of content)

Python validation scripts in PythonHelpers/:
- check_base_word_duplicates.py    - Stage 1: No base word in multiple packs
- check_combined_across_packs.py   - Stage 2+: Check combined array duplicates
- check_combined_duplicates.py     - Stage 2: Within-pack duplicate check
- validate_pinyin.py               - Stage 3+: 1 pinyin syllable per character
- validate_overview_csvs.py        - General: CSV structure validation

THE 4 STAGES:
-------------
Stage 1: BASE WORDS REVIEW
    - Input:  [Lang]_Base_Words column in Overview CSV
    - Output: Perfected base vocabulary items (single words/compound words)
    - Goal:   Each pack has ~15-20 excellent themed vocabulary items
    - Check:  No duplicates across packs (each word in ONE pack only)

Stage 2: EXAMPLE WORDS CREATION
    - Input:  Finalized Base_Words from Stage 1
    - Output: [Lang]_Example_Words column (2 examples per base word)
    - Goal:   Examples that CONTAIN the base word, showing context
    - Check:  Every example contains its base word as substring

Stage 3: BREAKOUT CSV CREATION
    - Input:  Combined_Words (Base + Example merged)
    - Output: Individual CSV files per pack (e.g., ChineseWords1.csv)
    - Goal:   Full translations in all target languages
    - Check:  Pinyin syllable count matches Chinese character count

Stage 4: JAVASCRIPT MODULE GENERATION
    - Input:  Breakout CSVs (ChineseWords1.csv, etc.)
    - Output: JS modules in two formats:
              * Clean: Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js (readable, for development)
              * Obfuscated: Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js (compressed, for production)
    - Goal:   Game-ready data that can be imported by the flashcard app

CRITICAL RULE - PYTHON VS MANUAL EDITING:
-----------------------------------------
Python scripts are ONLY for FINDING issues, NEVER for fixing them.
- Python: Detect duplicates, count mismatches, format errors
- Manual: Actually edit the CSV to fix the issues

EXCEPTION: Combined_Words column is created by Python.
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (simple array concatenation).
This is deterministic computation, not a "fix" - there's no judgment involved.

Why manual fixes for everything else? Python can make automated changes
that cascade into bigger problems. Human/LLM must understand what
they're changing and why.

JAVASCRIPT MODULE STRUCTURE:
----------------------------
The final output is JavaScript modules organized by "Acts" (learning stages).

CLEAN VERSION (for development, LLM-assisted coding):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js
    Format: Human-readable ES6 exports

    export const p1_1_greetings__goodbyes = {
      meta: {
        wordpack: 1,
        english: "Greetings & Goodbyes",
        chinese: "问候语",
        spanish: "Saludos y Despedidas",
        // ... other language titles
      },
      words: [
        ["你好", "nǐ hǎo", "hello", "hola", "bonjour", ...],
        ["再见", "zài jiàn", "goodbye", "adiós", "au revoir", ...],
        // ... more words
      ]
    };

OBFUSCATED VERSION (for production deployment):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js
    Format: Compressed + Base64 encoded

    Obfuscation method (3 layers):
    1. JSON.stringify the data
    2. Reverse the string (salt)
    3. Zlib compress
    4. Base64 encode

    To decode (in browser):
    - Import module (contains base64 string in 'w' export)
    - Base64 decode → Uint8Array
    - pako.inflate (zlib decompress)
    - Reverse string
    - JSON.parse → original data

COLUMN STRUCTURE BY LANGUAGE:
-----------------------------
CHINESE (12 columns):
    [0] chinese, [1] pinyin, [2] english, [3] spanish, [4] french,
    [5] portuguese, [6] vietnamese, [7] thai, [8] khmer,
    [9] indonesian, [10] malay, [11] filipino

SPANISH (5 columns):
    [0] spanish, [1] english, [2] chinese, [3] pinyin, [4] portuguese

ENGLISH (5 columns):
    [0] english, [1] chinese, [2] pinyin, [3] spanish, [4] portuguese

PINYIN CRITICAL RULE:
---------------------
Each Chinese character must have exactly ONE pinyin syllable, separated by spaces.
This allows the game UI to display pinyin directly under each character.

    CORRECT:   猴子 → "hóu zi"    (2 chars = 2 syllables)
    INCORRECT: 猴子 → "hóuzi"     (2 chars but 1 syllable - WRONG)

ACTS (Learning Progression):
----------------------------
Words are grouped into "Acts" representing learning stages:
    - Act I: Foundation (basic vocabulary)
    - Act II: Building Blocks / Development
    - Act III: Daily Life / Expansion
    - Act IV: Expanding Expression / Mastery
    - Act V: Advanced / Refinement
    - Act VI: Advanced Constructs (Spanish only)
    - Act VII: Mastery Fluency (Spanish only)

Each act contains multiple wordpacks (e.g., Act I might have packs 1-50).

QUALITY STANDARDS:
------------------
- Stage 1 score target: 9.0+ (base words are excellent vocabulary items)
- Stage 2 score target: 9.0+ (examples naturally contain base words)
- Stage 3 score target: 9.5+ (translations accurate, pinyin correct)
- Overall: Keep iterating until a fresh LLM instance rates it highly

THE FRESH LLM PRINCIPLE:
------------------------
After making improvements, always have a NEW LLM instance (one that has never
seen this wordpack before) rate the quality. This prevents:
- Confirmation bias (the editing LLM thinking its changes are good)
- Anchoring (being influenced by previous versions)
- Familiarity blindness (missing issues due to repeated exposure)

<h1>Wordpack Construction Pipeline</h1>

<div>
    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    <p>A multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality flashcard data for language learning (Chinese, Spanish, English).</p>

    <h4>The Iterative Quality Loop</h4>
    <p>Each stage follows: <strong>LLM reviews → scores 1-10 → makes changes → Python validates → fixes issues → scores again → if &lt;9, new LLM rates → repeat until 9+</strong></p>

    <h4>Why Python + LLM?</h4>
    <p>Python handles mechanical checks (duplicates, format, counting) quickly and accurately. LLMs focus on creative/semantic work (is this a good vocabulary word for this theme?).</p>

    <h4>Final Output</h4>

<h3>Chinese - Stage 1</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Review and perfect Chinese_Base_Words in ChineseWordsOverview.csv

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes
4. Run Python validation
5. Fix any issues Python finds
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, your output will be reviewed by a fresh LLM instance

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher (as rated by a fresh LLM that hasn't seen this before)

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

=== WHAT ARE BASE WORDS? ===
Base words are VOCABULARY ITEMS - single words or compound words that learners memorize.
Examples of GOOD base words: 你好, 星期六, 电脑, 谢谢, 早上好

Base words are NOT phrases, sentences, or words with added context.
- ✗ 我说你好 (phrase/sentence - NOT a base word)
- ✗ 他的电脑 (adds context - NOT a base word)
- ✓ 你好 (vocabulary item - GOOD)
- ✓ 电脑 (vocabulary item - GOOD)

=== CONTEXT COMES IN STAGE 2 - NOT NOW ===
Stage 2 creates Example_Words showing base words in context.
Your job in Stage 1 is ONLY to ensure base words are good vocabulary items.

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Does each base word fit the pack's theme?
- Are these useful vocabulary items learners should know?
- Are there duplicates or too-similar words within the pack?
- Are there obvious missing words for this theme?
- Is the difficulty appropriate for the pack's Act?

=== DO NOT ===
- Turn base words into phrases or sentences
- Add context to base words
- Worry about "lack of context" - that's Stage 2's job

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文) - NEVER Traditional Chinese
- Keep base words as vocabulary items (not phrases)
- You CAN add/remove/replace base words freely
- Roughly 15-20 words per pack is typical but very flexible

=== NO DUPLICATES ACROSS PACKS ===
After changes, run: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
Each base word must appear in ONLY ONE pack across all 107 packs.
If duplicates found, MANUALLY decide which pack fits best and MANUALLY remove from others.

=== CRITICAL: PYTHON = FIND, MANUAL = FIX ===
Python scripts ONLY find issues. They NEVER fix them.
YOU must MANUALLY edit the CSV to fix any issues Python finds.
NEVER use Python to automatically edit CSV files.

=== IDENTIFY GAPS ===
Note if obvious theme gaps deserve new packs.
Example: "Gap: No kitchen vocabulary. Suggest Pack 'Kitchen Items': [锅, 碗, 筷子, 勺子, ...]"

=== FILE INFO ===
FILE: ChineseWordsOverview.csv
COLUMN: Chinese_Base_Words

(See HTML tables above for before/after examples)

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current base words 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: Add/remove/replace vocabulary items
3. PYTHON CHECK: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
4. FIX: Remove any cross-pack duplicates
5. GAPS: Suggest new packs if themes missing
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements
7. If score < 9.0, explain what would make it 9.0+

=== FINAL OUTPUT (REQUIRED) ===
End your response with this exact table format:

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| BEFORE Score | X/10  |
| AFTER Score  | X/10  |
| Reason       | [1-2 sentence explanation of what improved] |

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes MANUALLY (⛔ NO PYTHON!)
4. Run Python validation for duplicates in Combined_Words
5. Fix any issues MANUALLY
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, iterate until quality is excellent

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

If Chinese_Example_Words column is EMPTY, this is the first run.
You must fill it out. Do not skip.

=== MOST IMPORTANT: CAREFULLY CURATED EXAMPLES ===
Examples are NOT random phrases that happen to contain the base word.
Examples must be CAREFULLY CURATED for maximum learning value:
- Use the MOST COMMON phrases a native speaker would actually say
- Choose phrases learners will encounter in real life
- Avoid obscure, literary, or rarely-used expressions
- Think: "What's the BEST example to help someone learn this word?"

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Are examples the MOST COMMON phrases for each base word?
- Would a native speaker actually say these phrases?
- Are examples useful for learners (not obscure/literary)?
- Does each example clearly demonstrate the base word's usage?
- Are there any duplicates within or across packs?

=== YOUR GOAL ===
For each base word, create 2 CAREFULLY CHOSEN example phrases that CONTAIN that base word.
Each example MUST CONTAIN its base word as a substring.

=== ⛔ NO PYTHON FOR GENERATION ===
Do NOT write Python. Do NOT automate. Type each example by hand.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
1. SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文)
2. Each base word → exactly 2 examples
3. Each example MUST CONTAIN the base word
4. Examples should be the MOST COMMON, USEFUL phrases
5. ⛔ NO PYTHON - MANUAL ONLY

=== STRUCTURE ===
Base_Words: [词1, 词2, 词3]
Example_Words: [词1例A, 词1例B, 词2例A, 词2例B, 词3例A, 词3例B]

=== EXAMPLE ===
Base_Words: [你好, 再见]
Example_Words: [你好吗, 你好啊, 再见朋友, 再见了]

=== COMBINED_WORDS DUPLICATE CHECK ===
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (created automatically by Python).
You must ensure NO DUPLICATES exist in Combined_Words:
- No duplicate within a single pack's Combined_Words
- No duplicate across different packs' Combined_Words

Run these scripts to CHECK (not fix):
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_duplicates.py
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_across_packs.py chinese
python PythonHelpers/validate_overview_csvs.py

These scripts ONLY find issues. They do NOT fix anything.
If duplicates found, YOU must MANUALLY fix your Example_Words.

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current examples 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: ⛔ MANUALLY create/improve examples (NO PYTHON!)
3. PYTHON CHECK: Run duplicate check scripts (checking only)

=== MOST IMPORTANT: BEST POSSIBLE TRANSLATIONS ===
Translations are NOT just "any correct translation."
Translations must be the BEST POSSIBLE for learners:
- Use the MOST NATURAL way a native speaker would say it
- Choose the translation learners will encounter most often
- Avoid awkward, overly formal, or rarely-used translations
- Think: "What's the BEST translation to help someone learn this?"

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Are translations the MOST NATURAL for each language?
- Would a native speaker of each language say it this way?
- Is pinyin correctly formatted (1 syllable per character, spaced)?
- Are there any duplicates or inconsistencies?
- Are translations useful for learners (not awkward/formal)?

=== ⛔ REMINDER: NO PYTHON FOR TRANSLATION ===
The task is massive (107 packs × 12 languages!). You still MUST do it manually.
Do NOT write Python to "speed things up."
Do NOT use any automation to generate translations.
Write each translation by hand, row by row, column by column.

=== PREREQUISITE ===
Stage 2 complete. Chinese_Combined_Words column exists.

=== YOUR GOAL ===
For each pack, create a breakout CSV with THE BEST translations for every word.
YOU must write each translation yourself. NO automation.

=== FILES ===
INPUT: ChineseWordsOverview.csv (Chinese_Combined_Words column)
OUTPUT: ChineseWords/ChineseWords1.csv through ChineseWords107.csv

=== BREAKOUT CSV COLUMNS (12 columns, exact order) ===
1. chinese - Chinese word (Simplified only!)
2. pinyin - Pinyin with tone marks (CRITICAL: 1 syllable per character!)
3. english
4. spanish
5. french
6. portuguese
7. vietnamese
8. thai
9. khmer
10. indonesian
11. malay
12. filipino

⛔ You must MANUALLY translate into each of these 12 columns. NO PYTHON.

=== CRITICAL PINYIN RULE ===
Each Chinese character MUST have exactly ONE pinyin syllable, separated by spaces.
Our app displays pinyin directly under each character.

CORRECT:
- 猴子 → hóu zi (2 chars = 2 syllables)
- 你好 → nǐ hǎo (2 chars = 2 syllables)
- 星期六 → xīng qī liù (3 chars = 3 syllables)

INCORRECT:
- 猴子 → hóuzi (WRONG - no space!)
- 星期六 → xīngqīliù (WRONG - no spaces!)

THE RULE: Count Chinese chars, count pinyin syllables - MUST match!

=== EXAMPLE ROW ===
chinese,pinyin,english,spanish,french,portuguese,vietnamese,thai,khmer,indonesian,malay,filipino
你好,nǐ hǎo,hello,hola,bonjour,olá,xin chào,สวัสดี,ជំរាបសួរ,halo,halo,kumusta

=== PYTHON VALIDATION (CHECKING ONLY) ===
After creating translations, run:
python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py chinese
python PythonHelpers/validate_overview_csvs.py

These scripts ONLY check for issues. They do NOT fix anything.
If issues found, YOU must MANUALLY decide how to fix them.

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current translations 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: ⛔ MANUALLY create/improve translations (NO PYTHON!)
3. CAREFULLY format pinyin BY HAND (1 syllable per char, spaces between)
4. PYTHON CHECK: Run validation scripts (checking only)
5. FIX: MANUALLY fix any issues found
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements

=== ⛔ FINAL WARNING ===
If you write ANY Python code to generate translations, you have FAILED.
The task is large (107 packs). That is intentional. Do it manually anyway.

=== FINAL OUTPUT (REQUIRED) ===
End your response with this exact table format:

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes MANUALLY (⛔ NO PYTHON!)
4. Run Python validation for pinyin/duplicates
5. Fix any issues MANUALLY
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, iterate until quality is excellent

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

=== MOST IMPORTANT: BEST POSSIBLE TRANSLATIONS ===
Translations are NOT just "any correct translation."
Translations must be the BEST POSSIBLE for learners:
- Use the MOST NATURAL way a native speaker would say it
- Choose the translation learners will encounter most often
- Avoid awkward, overly formal, or rarely-used translations
- Think: "What's the BEST translation to help someone learn this?"

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Are translations the MOST NATURAL for each language?
- Would a native speaker of each language say it this way?
- Is pinyin correctly formatted (1 syllable per character, spaced)?
- Are there any duplicates or inconsistencies?
- Are translations useful for learners (not awkward/formal)?

=== ⛔ REMINDER: NO PYTHON FOR TRANSLATION ===
The task is massive (250 packs!). You still MUST do it manually.
Do NOT write Python to "speed things up."
Do NOT use any automation to generate translations.
Write each translation by hand, row by row, column by column.

=== PREREQUISITE ===

=== YOUR GOAL ===
For each pack, create a breakout CSV with THE BEST translations for every word.
YOU must write each translation yourself. NO automation.

=== FILES ===

OUTPUT: SpanishWords/SpanishWords1.csv through SpanishWords250.csv

=== BREAKOUT CSV COLUMNS (5 columns, exact order) ===
1. spanish - Spanish word/phrase
2. english
3. chinese - Simplified Chinese only!
4. pinyin - 1 syllable per character, separated by spaces!
5. portuguese

⛔ You must MANUALLY translate into each of these 5 columns. NO PYTHON.

=== CRITICAL PINYIN RULE ===
CORRECT: 你好 → nǐ hǎo (space between syllables)
INCORRECT: 你好 → nǐhǎo (no space - WRONG)

<h3>Chinese - Stage 4</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Generate JavaScript modules from Chinese breakout CSVs

=== WHAT THIS STAGE PRODUCES ===
Two versions of JS modules:

1. CLEAN VERSION (for development):
   Location: ChineseWords/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js, act2-development.js, etc.
   Format: Human-readable ES6 exports
   Purpose: LLM-assisted coding, debugging, understanding data structure

2. OBFUSCATED VERSION (for production):
   Location: ChineseWords/Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js, etc.
   Format: Compressed + Base64 encoded
   Purpose: Actual game deployment, smaller file size

=== PREREQUISITE ===
Stage 3 complete. All ChineseWords1.csv through ChineseWords107.csv exist.

=== HOW TO RUN ===
python ChineseWords/ChineseWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py

=== OUTPUT JS MODULE STRUCTURE ===
Each act file exports multiple packs:

export const p1_1_greetings__goodbyes = {
  meta: {
    wordpack: 1,                    // Pack number (integer)
    chinese: "问候语",               // Title in Chinese
    pinyin: "wèn hòu yǔ",           // Title pinyin
    english: "Greetings & Goodbyes", // Title in English
    spanish: "Saludos",              // etc.
    // ... all supported languages
  },
  words: [
    ["你好", "nǐ hǎo", "hello", "hola", "bonjour", "olá", "xin chào", "สวัสดี", "ជំរាបសួរ", "halo", "halo", "kumusta"],
    ["再见", "zài jiàn", "goodbye", ...],
    // Each row is [chinese, pinyin, english, spanish, french, portuguese, vietnamese, thai, khmer, indonesian, malay, filipino]
  ]
};

=== OBFUSCATION METHOD (3 layers) ===
1. JSON.stringify(allPacksData)
2. Reverse the string (salt)
3. zlib.compress()
4. base64.encode()

Result: export const w = "base64string...";

=== TO DECODE IN BROWSER ===
Uses pako.js for decompression:
1. Import module (get 'w' export)
2. base64 decode → Uint8Array
3. pako.inflate()
4. Reverse string
5. JSON.parse() → original data

See DecoderTest.html for working example.

=== ACT MAPPING ===
Chinese has 5 acts:
- Act I: Foundation (act1-foundation.js)
- Act II: Development (act2-development.js)
- Act III: Expansion (act3-expansion.js)
- Act IV: Mastery (act4-mastery.js)
- Act V: Refinement (act5-refinement.js)

The Overview CSV's Difficulty_Act column determines which act each pack belongs to.

=== COLUMN INDICES FOR CHINESE (12 columns) ===
[0] chinese, [1] pinyin, [2] english, [3] spanish, [4] french,
[5] portuguese, [6] vietnamese, [7] thai, [8] khmer,
[9] indonesian, [10] malay, [11] filipino

=== VERIFICATION ===
After generation:
1. Check Jsmodules/ has all act files
2. Check Jsmodules-js/ has obfuscated versions
3. Load DecoderTest.html to verify decoding works
4. Spot-check a few packs for correct data

<h3>Fresh LLM Rating Prompt</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Rate the quality of wordpack data (UNBIASED REVIEW)

=== IMPORTANT ===
You are rating work done by another LLM agent. You have NOT seen this data before.
Provide an honest, unbiased assessment. Do not assume the work is good.

=== WHAT TO RATE ===
Rate each aspect 1-10 and provide an OVERALL score.

For BASE WORDS (Stage 1):
- Theme fit: Do words match the pack's stated theme?
- Usefulness: Are these words learners should know?
- Completeness: Are obvious words missing?
- No phrases: Are all entries vocabulary items (not sentences)?
- No duplicates: Each word appears in only one pack?

For EXAMPLE WORDS (Stage 2):
- Contains base word: Does each example contain its base word?
- Natural usage: Are examples phrases people actually say?
- Variety: Are the 2 examples per word different enough?
- Correct count: Exactly 2 examples per base word?

For TRANSLATIONS (Stage 3):
- Accuracy: Are translations correct?
- Pinyin format: 1 syllable per character, spaces between?
- Simplified Chinese: No Traditional characters?
- Consistency: Same quality across all rows?

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Theme Fit: X/10 - [brief comment]
Usefulness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Completeness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Format Correctness: X/10 - [brief comment]
...

OVERALL SCORE: X/10

SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND:
1. [Issue and how to fix]
2. [Issue and how to fix]
...

VERDICT: [PASS if >= 9.0] or [NEEDS IMPROVEMENT if < 9.0]

=== BE HONEST ===
If the work is excellent, say so. If it has problems, list them clearly.
