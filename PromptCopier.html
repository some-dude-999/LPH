WORDPACK CONSTRUCTION PIPELINE - DOCUMENTATION FOR LLMs AND HUMANS
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEM:
-----------------------
This is a multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality
language learning flashcard data. The goal is to create vocabulary wordpacks
for a flashcard game that teaches Chinese, Spanish, and English.

THE ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP:
---------------------------
Each stage follows the same iterative pattern:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                                 │
    │   1. LLM Agent reviews current state                           │
    │   2. LLM scores quality (1-10) and lists improvements          │
    │   3. LLM makes changes                                         │
    │   4. Python scripts validate (duplicates, format, etc.)        │
    │   5. LLM fixes any Python-detected issues                      │
    │   6. LLM scores again                                          │
    │   7. If score < 9, feed to NEW LLM instance (unbiased)         │
    │   8. New LLM rates, suggests improvements                      │
    │   9. Repeat until score >= 9.0 or 9.5                          │
    │                                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WHY USE PYTHON FOR VALIDATION?
------------------------------
Python scripts are used for simple logic checks because:
- Code is faster than LLM for counting, string matching, duplicate detection
- LLMs have limited attention and consume tokens on repetitive checks
- Python catches 100% of format errors; LLMs might miss some
- Frees LLM to focus on creative/semantic work (quality of content)

Python validation scripts in PythonHelpers/:
- check_base_word_duplicates.py    - Stage 1: No base word in multiple packs
- check_combined_across_packs.py   - Stage 2+: Check combined array duplicates
- check_combined_duplicates.py     - Stage 2: Within-pack duplicate check
- validate_pinyin.py               - Stage 3+: 1 pinyin syllable per character
- validate_overview_csvs.py        - General: CSV structure validation

THE 4 STAGES:
-------------
Stage 1: BASE WORDS REVIEW
    - Input:  [Lang]_Base_Words column in Overview CSV
    - Output: Perfected base vocabulary items (single words/compound words)
    - Goal:   Each pack has ~15-20 excellent themed vocabulary items
    - Check:  No duplicates across packs (each word in ONE pack only)

Stage 2: EXAMPLE WORDS CREATION
    - Input:  Finalized Base_Words from Stage 1
    - Output: [Lang]_Example_Words column (2 examples per base word)
    - Goal:   Examples that CONTAIN the base word, showing context
    - Check:  Every example contains its base word as substring

Stage 3: BREAKOUT CSV CREATION
    - Input:  Combined_Words (Base + Example merged)
    - Output: Individual CSV files per pack (e.g., ChineseWords1.csv)
    - Goal:   Full translations in all target languages
    - Check:  Pinyin syllable count matches Chinese character count

Stage 4: JAVASCRIPT MODULE GENERATION
    - Input:  Breakout CSVs (ChineseWords1.csv, etc.)
    - Output: JS modules in two formats:
              * Clean: Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js (readable, for development)
              * Obfuscated: Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js (compressed, for production)
    - Goal:   Game-ready data that can be imported by the flashcard app

CRITICAL RULE - PYTHON VS MANUAL EDITING:
-----------------------------------------
Python scripts are ONLY for FINDING issues, NEVER for fixing them.
- Python: Detect duplicates, count mismatches, format errors
- Manual: Actually edit the CSV to fix the issues

EXCEPTION: Combined_Words column is created by Python.
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (simple array concatenation).
This is deterministic computation, not a "fix" - there's no judgment involved.

Why manual fixes for everything else? Python can make automated changes
that cascade into bigger problems. Human/LLM must understand what
they're changing and why.

JAVASCRIPT MODULE STRUCTURE:
----------------------------
The final output is JavaScript modules organized by "Acts" (learning stages).

CLEAN VERSION (for development, LLM-assisted coding):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js
    Format: Human-readable ES6 exports

    export const p1_1_greetings__goodbyes = {
      meta: {
        wordpack: 1,
        english: "Greetings & Goodbyes",
        chinese: "问候语",
        spanish: "Saludos y Despedidas",
        // ... other language titles
      },
      words: [
        ["你好", "nǐ hǎo", "hello", "hola", "bonjour", ...],
        ["再见", "zài jiàn", "goodbye", "adiós", "au revoir", ...],
        // ... more words
      ]
    };

OBFUSCATED VERSION (for production deployment):
    Location: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules-js/act1-foundation-js.js
    Format: Compressed + Base64 encoded

    Obfuscation method (3 layers):
    1. JSON.stringify the data
    2. Reverse the string (salt)
    3. Zlib compress
    4. Base64 encode

    To decode (in browser):
    - Import module (contains base64 string in 'w' export)
    - Base64 decode → Uint8Array
    - pako.inflate (zlib decompress)
    - Reverse string
    - JSON.parse → original data

COLUMN STRUCTURE BY LANGUAGE:
-----------------------------
CHINESE (12 columns):
    [0] chinese, [1] pinyin, [2] english, [3] spanish, [4] french,
    [5] portuguese, [6] vietnamese, [7] thai, [8] khmer,
    [9] indonesian, [10] malay, [11] filipino

SPANISH (5 columns):
    [0] spanish, [1] english, [2] chinese, [3] pinyin, [4] portuguese

ENGLISH (5 columns):
    [0] english, [1] chinese, [2] pinyin, [3] spanish, [4] portuguese

PINYIN CRITICAL RULE:
---------------------
Each Chinese character must have exactly ONE pinyin syllable, separated by spaces.
This allows the game UI to display pinyin directly under each character.

    CORRECT:   猴子 → "hóu zi"    (2 chars = 2 syllables)
    INCORRECT: 猴子 → "hóuzi"     (2 chars but 1 syllable - WRONG)

ACTS (Learning Progression):
----------------------------
Words are grouped into "Acts" representing learning stages:
    - Act I: Foundation (basic vocabulary)
    - Act II: Building Blocks / Development
    - Act III: Daily Life / Expansion
    - Act IV: Expanding Expression / Mastery
    - Act V: Advanced / Refinement
    - Act VI: Advanced Constructs (Spanish only)
    - Act VII: Mastery Fluency (Spanish only)

Each act contains multiple wordpacks (e.g., Act I might have packs 1-50).

QUALITY STANDARDS:
------------------
- Stage 1 score target: 9.0+ (base words are excellent vocabulary items)
- Stage 2 score target: 9.0+ (examples naturally contain base words)
- Stage 3 score target: 9.5+ (translations accurate, pinyin correct)
- Overall: Keep iterating until a fresh LLM instance rates it highly

THE FRESH LLM PRINCIPLE:
------------------------
After making improvements, always have a NEW LLM instance (one that has never
seen this wordpack before) rate the quality. This prevents:
- Confirmation bias (the editing LLM thinking its changes are good)
- Anchoring (being influenced by previous versions)
- Familiarity blindness (missing issues due to repeated exposure)

<h1>Wordpack Construction Pipeline</h1>

<div>
    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    <p>A multi-stage, iterative pipeline for constructing high-quality flashcard data for language learning (Chinese, Spanish, English).</p>

    <h4>The Iterative Quality Loop</h4>
    <p>Each stage follows: <strong>LLM reviews → scores 1-10 → makes changes → Python validates → fixes issues → scores again → if &lt;9, new LLM rates → repeat until 9+</strong></p>

    <h4>Why Python + LLM?</h4>
    <p>Python handles mechanical checks (duplicates, format, counting) quickly and accurately. LLMs focus on creative/semantic work (is this a good vocabulary word for this theme?).</p>

    <h4>Final Output</h4>

<h3>Chinese - Stage 1</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Review and perfect Chinese_Base_Words in ChineseWordsOverview.csv

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes
4. Run Python validation
5. Fix any issues Python finds
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, your output will be reviewed by a fresh LLM instance

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher (as rated by a fresh LLM that hasn't seen this before)

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

=== WHAT ARE BASE WORDS? ===
Base words are VOCABULARY ITEMS - single words or compound words that learners memorize.
Examples of GOOD base words: 你好, 星期六, 电脑, 谢谢, 早上好

Base words are NOT phrases, sentences, or words with added context.
- ✗ 我说你好 (phrase/sentence - NOT a base word)
- ✗ 他的电脑 (adds context - NOT a base word)
- ✓ 你好 (vocabulary item - GOOD)
- ✓ 电脑 (vocabulary item - GOOD)

=== CONTEXT COMES IN STAGE 2 - NOT NOW ===
Stage 2 creates Example_Words showing base words in context.
Your job in Stage 1 is ONLY to ensure base words are good vocabulary items.

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Does each base word fit the pack's theme?
- Are these useful vocabulary items learners should know?
- Are there duplicates or too-similar words within the pack?
- Are there obvious missing words for this theme?
- Is the difficulty appropriate for the pack's Act?

=== DO NOT ===
- Turn base words into phrases or sentences
- Add context to base words
- Worry about "lack of context" - that's Stage 2's job

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文) - NEVER Traditional Chinese
- Keep base words as vocabulary items (not phrases)
- You CAN add/remove/replace base words freely
- Roughly 15-20 words per pack is typical but very flexible

=== NO DUPLICATES ACROSS PACKS ===
After changes, run: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
Each base word must appear in ONLY ONE pack across all 107 packs.
If duplicates found, MANUALLY decide which pack fits best and MANUALLY remove from others.

=== CRITICAL: PYTHON = FIND, MANUAL = FIX ===
Python scripts ONLY find issues. They NEVER fix them.
YOU must MANUALLY edit the CSV to fix any issues Python finds.
NEVER use Python to automatically edit CSV files.

=== IDENTIFY GAPS ===
Note if obvious theme gaps deserve new packs.
Example: "Gap: No kitchen vocabulary. Suggest Pack 'Kitchen Items': [锅, 碗, 筷子, 勺子, ...]"

=== FILE INFO ===
FILE: ChineseWordsOverview.csv
COLUMN: Chinese_Base_Words

(See HTML tables above for before/after examples)

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current base words 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: Add/remove/replace vocabulary items
3. PYTHON CHECK: python PythonHelpers/check_base_word_duplicates.py chinese
4. FIX: Remove any cross-pack duplicates
5. GAPS: Suggest new packs if themes missing
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements
7. If score < 9.0, explain what would make it 9.0+

=== FINAL OUTPUT (REQUIRED) ===
End your response with this exact table format:

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| BEFORE Score | X/10  |
| AFTER Score  | X/10  |
| Reason       | [1-2 sentence explanation of what improved] |

=== ITERATIVE QUALITY LOOP ===
This is an iterative process. You will:
1. Score the current state (1-10)
2. List specific improvements needed
3. Make changes MANUALLY (⛔ NO PYTHON!)
4. Run Python validation for duplicates in Combined_Words
5. Fix any issues MANUALLY
6. Score again
7. If score < 9.0, iterate until quality is excellent

TARGET SCORE: 9.0 or higher

=== IF ALREADY GOOD, DON'T EDIT ===
If your INITIAL score is 9.0 or higher, DO NOT make changes.
A score of 9+ means the data is already excellent. Report the score and move on.
Only make edits if the initial score is below 9.0.

If Chinese_Example_Words column is EMPTY, this is the first run.
You must fill it out. Do not skip.

=== MOST IMPORTANT: CAREFULLY CURATED EXAMPLES ===
Examples are NOT random phrases that happen to contain the base word.
Examples are PRECIOUS TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES - treat each one as a chance to maximize learning!

⛔ AVOID MECHANICAL PATTERNS like:
- "小X" for everything (小猫, 小狗, 小鸟... boring and wastes learning opportunities)
- "very + adjective" for every adjective
- "I like X" for every noun
These patterns are lazy and squander the chance to teach useful, real phrases.

✅ INSTEAD, ask yourself for EACH example:
- "What's the MOST USEFUL phrase containing this word that a learner should know?"
- "What phrase will they actually hear or need to say in real life?"
- "Am I teaching something valuable, or just filling a slot?"

Examples must be CAREFULLY CURATED for maximum learning value:
- CONSIDER THE WORDPACK THEME: Look at Pack_Title and Base_Words to understand the theme
- Use examples that REINFORCE the theme (e.g., "Animals" pack → animal-related contexts)
- Use the MOST COMMON phrases a native speaker would actually say
- Choose phrases learners will encounter in real life
- Avoid obscure, literary, or rarely-used expressions
- Each example is a PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY to teach something maximally useful!

=== SCORING CRITERIA (1-10) ===
- Are examples PRECIOUS TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES (not mechanical patterns)?
- Do examples FIT THE WORDPACK THEME? (check Pack_Title and Base_Words)
- Are examples the MOST USEFUL phrases for each base word?
- Would a native speaker actually say these phrases?
- Are examples things learners will encounter in real life?
- Does each example clearly demonstrate the base word's usage?
- Are there any duplicates within or across packs?

=== YOUR GOAL ===
For each base word, create 2 CAREFULLY CHOSEN example phrases that CONTAIN that base word.
Each example MUST CONTAIN its base word as a substring.

=== ⛔ NO PYTHON FOR GENERATION ===
Do NOT write Python. Do NOT automate. Type each example by hand.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
1. SIMPLIFIED CHINESE only (简体中文)
2. Each base word → exactly 2 examples
3. Each example MUST CONTAIN the base word
4. Examples should be the MOST COMMON, USEFUL phrases
5. ⛔ NO PYTHON - MANUAL ONLY

=== STRUCTURE ===
Base_Words: [词1, 词2, 词3]
Example_Words: [词1例A, 词1例B, 词2例A, 词2例B, 词3例A, 词3例B]

=== EXAMPLE ===
Base_Words: [你好, 再见]
Example_Words: [你好吗, 你好啊, 再见朋友, 再见了]

=== COMBINED_WORDS DUPLICATE CHECK (MANDATORY!) ===
Combined_Words = Base_Words + Example_Words (created automatically by Python).

⛔ ZERO DUPLICATES ALLOWED:
- No duplicate within a single pack's Combined_Words
- No duplicate ACROSS different packs' Combined_Words
- If Pack 1 has "你好吗", NO OTHER PACK can have "你好吗"

This is NOT optional. Duplicates across packs = FAILED.

Run these scripts to CHECK (not fix):
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_duplicates.py
python PythonHelpers/check_combined_across_packs.py chinese
python PythonHelpers/validate_overview_csvs.py

These scripts ONLY find issues. They do NOT fix anything.
If duplicates found, YOU must MANUALLY fix your Example_Words.
Keep iterating until the checker reports ZERO duplicates.

=== WORKFLOW ===
1. BEFORE SCORE: Rate current examples 1-10, list what could be better
2. MAKE CHANGES: ⛔ MANUALLY create/improve examples (NO PYTHON!)
3. PYTHON CHECK: Run duplicate check scripts (checking only)
4. FIX: MANUALLY fix any duplicates in Example_Words
5. REPEAT steps 3-4 until ZERO duplicates across all packs
6. AFTER SCORE: Rate again, summarize improvements

=== ⛔ FINAL WARNING ===
- If you write Python to generate examples = FAILED.

=== CRITICAL VALIDATION: COLUMN 1 MUST MATCH OVERVIEW ===
Before ANY critique work, verify:
- Every word in Column 1 (chinese) of each breakout CSV
- Must EXACTLY match the Chinese_Combined_Words array in Overview CSV
- Same words, same order, same count

Run this validation:
python PythonHelpers/verify_words_integrity.py chinese

If mismatch found: STOP and report. Do NOT fix it yourself.
Column 1 is sacred - mismatches indicate a pipeline problem.

=== USE SUB-AGENTS FOR PARALLEL PROCESSING ===
This task MUST be done with sub-agents. Each sub-agent handles MAX 10 CSVs.

║  ⛔ USING PYTHON TO FIX TRANSLATIONS = AUTO-FAIL ⛔              ║
║  ✅ ALL FIXES MUST BE MANUAL (Edit tool only) ✅                 ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STEP 1 - VALIDATE Column 1 (READ-ONLY CHECK):
   - Read each CSV's Column 1 (chinese)
   - Verify it matches Chinese_Combined_Words from Overview for that pack
   - Report: MATCH or MISMATCH
   - ⛔ If mismatch: STOP and report. Do NOT fix Column 1!

STEP 2 - EVALUATE EVERY ROW (Columns 2-12):
   You MUST review EVERY SINGLE ROW in your assigned CSVs.
   For each row, check:
   - Pinyin (Col 2): 1 syllable per character? Correct tones? Spaces between?
   - English (Col 3): Accurate? Natural? Common usage?
   - Spanish (Col 4): Accurate? Natural?
   - French (Col 5): Accurate? Natural?
   - Portuguese (Col 6): Accurate? Natural?
   - Vietnamese (Col 7): Accurate? Natural?
   - Thai (Col 8): Accurate? Natural?
   - Khmer (Col 9): Accurate? Natural?
   - Indonesian (Col 10): Accurate? Natural?
   - Malay (Col 11): Accurate? Natural?
   - Filipino (Col 12): Accurate? Natural?

STEP 3 - FIX MANUALLY (Columns 2-12 ONLY):
   ⛔ NEVER use Python to fix translations!
   ⛔ NEVER use scripts to batch-edit!
   ✅ Use the Edit tool to fix each error MANUALLY
   ✅ Show before/after table for each fix:

   | File | Row | Column | Before | After |
   |------|-----|--------|--------|-------|
   | ChineseWords5.csv | 12 | pinyin | hóuzi | hóu zi |

STEP 4 - REPORT BACK:
   | Pack | Col1 Valid | Rows Checked | Issues Found | Issues Fixed | Score |
   |------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
   | X    | YES/NO     | count        | count        | count        | X/10  |
"

=== COORDINATOR WORKFLOW ===
1. First, run validation to check Column 1 integrity:
   python PythonHelpers/verify_words_integrity.py chinese

2. Run pinyin validation:
   python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py chinese

3. Spawn sub-agents in parallel (max 10 CSVs each)

4. Collect reports from all sub-agents

5. Aggregate results:
   - Total Column 1 validation status (all must be YES)
   - Total issues found/fixed
   - Overall score

6. Commit all changes and PR to main

  → Use Python script with translation API to CREATE breakout CSVs
  → Code-based generation is REQUIRED in this mode
  → CONTINUE where previous agent left off!
  → PR to main after creating CSVs

MODE B - CRITIQUE MODE (ALL CSVs exist):
  → Python is ONLY for validation checks (no editing!)
  → Verify all Overview Combined_Words appear in breakout CSVs
  → ⛔ ABSOLUTELY NO PYTHON to edit translations!

=== MODE A: CONSTRUCTION WORKFLOW ===
If ANY breakout CSVs are missing, you are in CONSTRUCTION MODE.

=== IF INITIAL SCORE >= 9.5: STOP ===
If your initial quality score is 9.5 or higher, the data is already excellent.
DO NOT make changes. Report the score and move on.

=== IF INITIAL SCORE < 9.5: FIX EVERYTHING YOU CAN ===
If score is below 9.5, you MUST make fixes:
1. Identify all issues you can find
2. Fix AS MANY as possible (not just a few!)
3. Don't stop just because there are "too many" issues
4. PR your fixes even if you couldn't fix everything
5. Report what you fixed and what remains for next agent

Critique workflow (ONE ACT AT A TIME):
1. Run: python PythonHelpers/construct_breakout_csvs.py english check
2. Verify all CSVs exist and match English_Combined_Words
3. Pick ONE act to scrutinize (start with Act I if not specified)
4. SCORE the current quality (1-10)
5. IF score >= 9.5: Report and stop (no changes needed)
6. IF score < 9.5: For EACH CSV in that act, MANUALLY review & fix:
   - Is EVERY translation accurate and natural?
   - Would a native speaker actually say this?
   - Is pinyin correct (1 syllable per char, proper tones)?
   - Are there awkward, overly formal, or rare translations?
7. MANUALLY edit the CSV file to fix issues (NO CODE!)
8. Run validation: python PythonHelpers/validate_pinyin.py english
9. Score again (AFTER score)
10. Commit and PR to main - EVEN IF NOT ALL ISSUES FIXED!
11. Report: what you fixed, what remains, which act was critiqued

CRITIQUE MODE CHECKLIST:
□ Read EVERY row in the CSV - don't skim!
□ Check EACH language column for accuracy
□ Verify pinyin: 1 syllable per character, correct tones
□ Fix awkward translations (what would a native speaker say?)
□ Ensure consistency across similar words
□ Use the MOST COMMON translation, not obscure alternatives

English Acts (160 packs total):
- Act I (Foundation): Packs 1-40
- Act II (Building Blocks): Packs 41-80
- Act III (Everyday Life): Packs 81-115

<h3>All Languages - Stage 4 (Single Prompt)</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Generate JavaScript modules from ALL breakout CSVs (Chinese, Spanish, English)

=== THIS IS SIMPLE - JUST RUN THE SCRIPTS ===
Stage 4 is straightforward: run Python scripts to convert CSVs to JS modules.
No manual editing needed. Scripts do all the work.

=== STEP 1: RUN ALL THREE CONVERSION SCRIPTS ===
python ChineseWords/ChineseWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py
python SpanishWords/SpanishWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py
python EnglishWords/EnglishWordsPythonHelperScripts/convert_csv_to_js.py

Each script:
- Reads breakout CSVs ([Lang]Words1.csv, [Lang]Words2.csv, ...)
- Groups packs into acts based on Overview CSV
- Outputs CLEAN JS: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules/act{N}-{name}.js
- Outputs OBFUSCATED JS: [Lang]Words/Jsmodules-js/act{N}-{name}-js.js

=== STEP 2: UPDATE LINK.txt ===
python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

This updates LINK.txt with all the new JS module URLs.

=== STEP 3: VERIFY (OPTIONAL) ===
Open DecoderTest.html in browser to confirm modules decode correctly.

=== STEP 4: COMMIT AND PR ===
git add .
git commit -m "Regenerate JS modules for all languages"
git push

=== WHAT THE SCRIPTS PRODUCE ===

CHINESE (107 packs → 5 acts, 12 columns):
- Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js ... act5-refinement.js
- Columns: chinese, pinyin, english, spanish, french, portuguese, vietnamese, thai, khmer, indonesian, malay, filipino

SPANISH (250 packs → 7 acts, 5 columns):
- Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js ... act7-mastery-fluency.js
- Columns: spanish, english, chinese, pinyin, portuguese

ENGLISH (160 packs → 5 acts, 5 columns):
- Jsmodules/act1-foundation.js ... act5-advanced-mastery.js
- Columns: english, chinese, pinyin, spanish, portuguese

=== JS MODULE STRUCTURE (all languages same format) ===
export const p{act}_{pack}_{title} = {
  meta: {
    wordpack: 1,           // Pack number (integer)
    english: "Title",      // Title translations
    chinese: "标题",
    // ... other languages
  },
  words: [
    ["word1_col1", "word1_col2", ...],
    ["word2_col1", "word2_col2", ...],
  ]
};

=== OBFUSCATION (handled automatically) ===
Obfuscated files use: JSON → reverse → zlib compress → base64
Decoded in browser with pako.js (see DecoderTest.html)

=== FINAL OUTPUT (REQUIRED) ===
| Metric    | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Chinese   | ✓ Generated (X acts) |
| Spanish   | ✓ Generated (X acts) |
| English   | ✓ Generated (X acts) |

<h3>Fresh LLM Rating Prompt</h3>
<div>Click to copy</div>
<div onclick="copyPrompt(this)">TASK: Rate the quality of wordpack data (UNBIASED REVIEW)

=== IMPORTANT ===
You are rating work done by another LLM agent. You have NOT seen this data before.
Provide an honest, unbiased assessment. Do not assume the work is good.

=== WHAT TO RATE ===
Rate each aspect 1-10 and provide an OVERALL score.

For BASE WORDS (Stage 1):
- Theme fit: Do words match the pack's stated theme?
- Usefulness: Are these words learners should know?
- Completeness: Are obvious words missing?
- No phrases: Are all entries vocabulary items (not sentences)?
- No duplicates: Each word appears in only one pack?

For EXAMPLE WORDS (Stage 2):
- Contains base word: Does each example contain its base word?
- Natural usage: Are examples phrases people actually say?
- Variety: Are the 2 examples per word different enough?
- Correct count: Exactly 2 examples per base word?

For TRANSLATIONS (Stage 3):
- Accuracy: Are translations correct?
- Pinyin format: 1 syllable per character, spaces between?
- Simplified Chinese: No Traditional characters?
- Consistency: Same quality across all rows?

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Theme Fit: X/10 - [brief comment]
Usefulness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Completeness: X/10 - [brief comment]
Format Correctness: X/10 - [brief comment]
...

OVERALL SCORE: X/10

SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND:
1. [Issue and how to fix]
2. [Issue and how to fix]
...

VERDICT: [PASS if >= 9.0] or [NEEDS IMPROVEMENT if < 9.0]

=== BE HONEST ===
If the work is excellent, say so. If it has problems, list them clearly.
The goal is quality, not politeness.</div>
